    "summary": "Despite what Google describes as a 'shift towards censorship' from big tech companies over the past three years, Democrat presidential candidates have said that they will use the power of the law to force even more censorship from Silicon Valley.\nResponding to a query from the far-left website Vox, Democrat candidates including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg all pledged to force big tech companies to crack down on 'hate' even further.\n\n\nSome even implied that absent the protections of Section 230, tech companies could somehow be held legally accountable for hate speech. This is incorrect — 'hate speech' is legal under the First Amendment.\n'Tech giants and online platforms should not be shielded from responsibility when they knowingly allow content on their platforms that promotes and facilitates violence,' said Bernie Sanders, who also promised to ensure that 'right-wing groups' don't 'abuse regulation' of tech companies to 'advance their agenda.'\nSen. Sanders said that Section 230 was written 'written well before the current era of online communities, expression, and technological development' and that he would, therefore, work to ensure tech companies are held accountable for 'dangerous activity' on their platforms.\n\nCandidate Michael Bennet also made the incorrect claim that removing Section 230 protections from social media companies would somehow allow big tech to be legally liable for First Amendment protected speech.\n'It is time to revisit the broad immunity provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which in many cases has shielded tech companies from accountability for misinformation and hate speech on their platforms,' said Bennet.\nPete Buttigieg was more moderate, saying that tech companies should merely be 'called out.'\n'Sites that traffic in hate and encourage or fail to moderate abuse and hate should be called out as facilitating socially harmful speech,' said the candidate.\nElizabeth Warren also stopped short of saying she would specifically seek legal accountability for hate speech on social media, instead promising to tackle anticompetitive behavior.\n'Big tech companies cannot continue to hide behind free speech while profiting off of hate speech and disinformation campaigns,' said Warren.\n'That's why I've called out Facebook for operating as a disinformation-for-profit machine and why I'm committed to unwinding Facebook's anti-competitive mergers and cracking down on practices that allow the company to undermine our democracy.'\nAre you an insider at Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?

    "excerpt": "Competition for tech jobs is up and workers could lose bargaining power.",
    "summary": "Key Points: Since mid-May, tech job postings have trended below overall job postings and for weeks have remained approximately 36% below last year's trend. The damage is widespread, with tech postings doing worse than job postings overall in half of tech hubs and 89% of non-tech hubs as of July 24. Competition for tech jobs is rising, which may be due in part to tech's work-from-home options. The US continues to struggle to contain coronavirus and its economic fallout. The economy has improved recently, but the possibility of another round of lockdowns looms amid a resurgence of the virus in southern and western states.  At the beginning of the crisis, tech job postings initially fared better than overall postings. That may be because lots of tech work doesn't require much face-to-face interaction. What's more, some tech companies already had remote work policies in place, making it easy to scale up work from home.  Tech postings trend languishes However, as the pandemic progresses, tech postings now are performing worse than the overall job market. Tech postings started to fall behind in mid-May and, since then, the gap has grown steadily. On July 24, the overall job postings trend was 21% below its 2019 level. But tech jobs were hit harder, settling at 36% below last year's level for weeks and showing no signs of bouncing back. Tech's failure to recover is probably due to the high cost of hiring and firing. While a restaurant may take on workers based on demand experienced over the past two weeks, sectors like tech have much longer planning horizons. And with so much uncertainty, as highlighted in the Congressional Budget's Office latest economic outlook, bringing on new employees may be a low priority now. However, not all tech jobs have been hit equally hard. Through July 24, IT operations and help desk jobs were down 32% and system engineering jobs 31% from last year's trend, better than tech jobs overall. Wide adoption of remote work probably explains why these types of tech jobs are doing better.  Meanwhile, software development jobs are in sync with overall tech postings at 35% below the 2019 trend. But data scientist and IT management posting trends are down sharply, at 43% and 45% below a year ago respectively. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, a subgroup of software development, is 29% under the 2019 trend, showing that coronavirus has pummelled even what until recently was the poster child for cutting-edge tech jobs. Economic damage widespread Through July 24, the overall job postings trend in all of the eight tech hubs identified by Indeed, was down more than the 21% decline in overall postings nationally. In addition, in half the hubs, tech postings are recovering slower than overall postings. The gap is widest in Raleigh, NC, where the overall postings trend was down 26% from a year ago, while tech job postings were off 45%. Outside tech hubs, the underperformance of tech job postings is even more pronounced. For example, in tech hubs, data science job postings were trending 37% below a year ago as of July 24, while in non-hubs, data science postings were off 51%. The plunge in postings for data scientists both in and out of tech hubs is quite a turnaround from last year, when candidates for this occupation were in hot demand. Employers may be viewing data science analysis as an investment that isn't immediately critical for business. This pattern of a greater decline in tech postings outside major tech hubs is evident not only in data science, but in all tech subcategories. This may be because more-established tech companies, which often are sited in tech hubs, are more likely to have the financial resources to ride out a crisis. The poorer performance of non-tech hubs reverses the previous tendency, in which smaller tech centers had been gaining on the eight hubs. Amid great uncertainty about coronavirus, tech companies may be pushing for centralization in major hubs rather than dispersion.  Tech job seekers have more competition  As tech postings have declined, relative job seeker interest in the sector has risen. In February, tech job postings received 68% of the clicks of the average posting. By July 24, tech postings were attracting 95% of the clicks of the average job. More clicks per posting means that, relative to employment opportunities, more people are interested in these jobs than in the pre-COVID era. This greater competition could spell a loss of bargaining power for tech workers. If more people want these jobs, tech companies may scale back benefits like unlimited personal time off.   Some of this rising interest is probably driven by tech's quick and widespread adoption of work from home. Announcements about permanent remote options from tech giants like Facebook and Twitter undoubtedly grabbed job seekers' attention. On the days of these announcements, the share of searches per million for Twitter and Facebook skyrocketed. And while ‘online' and ‘wfh' (work from home) have been fast-growing search terms during coronavirus, some of the interest may also be because it is no longer necessary for new hires to live in the hyper-expensive San Francisco Bay Area. Case in point: rent in the Bay area is falling, probably because tech workers are leaving and the influx of new tech workers has shriveled.   Conclusion It looks to be a long road ahead for the tech sector. The economic damage caused by coronavirus has been vast. And, even though the overall job market has recovered a bit, the tech job postings trend has yet to bounce back. Within the broad tech sector, there are variations. IT help and system engineering jobs are faring relatively better, while data science and IT management are doing worse. Tech jobs outside the major tech hubs are especially hurting, and these areas could lose the ground they had gained on those tech centers before coronavirus. This mainly reflects the uncertainty generated by coronavirus, which is clouding business forecasts and making it tough to carry out long-term budgeting.  With fewer tech job postings and increased job seeker interest,in the field, competition for sector jobs is heating up. Companies are back in the driver's seat, which could reduce tech worker bargaining power. In addition, benefits like unlimited time off and well-stocked snack bars could go on the chopping block. At the same time though, substantial geographic diversification of the tech workforce could occur if the sector widely adopts permanent remote work. Unless that happens, jobs may continue to concentrate in the major tech hubs, tightening the hold of places like Silicon Valley on this strategic part of the economy.  Methodology Tech jobs were identified using a curated list of 564 tech-related job titles. Metros analyzed had a minimum population of 250,000. The six highlighted tech categories make up 93% of all tech jobs. To measure job posting trends, we calculated the seven-day moving average of the number of US job postings on Indeed. We indexed each day's seven-day moving average to the start of that year (Feb 1, 2020 = 100 for 2020 data, and so on) or another date if specified in the chart. We report how the trend in job postings this year differs from last year's trend in order to focus on recent changes in labor market conditions due to COVID-19. For example, if job postings for a country increased 30% from February 1, 2019, to May 22, 2019, but only 20% from February 1, 2020, to May 22, 2020, then the index would have risen from 100 to 130 in 2019 and 100 to 120 in 2020. The year-to-date job posting trend would therefore be down 7.7% on May 22 (120 is 7.7% below 130) in 2020 relative to 2019. AnnElizabeth Konkel is an Economist on the Indeed Hiring Lab who focuses on the US labor market.

    "excerpt": "Tech TAs are available through the summer to assist Penn State faculty with delivering their courses over Zoom.",
    "summary": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Less than two weeks after Penn State transitioned to remote teaching, the Tech TAs program debuted to provide faculty real-time, on-demand Zoom support so they could focus on delivering lessons and not video-conferencing technology. Thanks to a positive reception and the continuation of remote teaching, Tech TAs will be available during summer courses.\nIn an anonymous survey of faculty who utilized Tech TAs during the spring semester, 100% of respondents indicated that they would recommend the service to a colleague and that Tech TAs added value to their courses. Additionally, over 90% of respondents mentioned they would use Tech TAs again, and that they helped to meet their students' needs.\nOne survey respondent replied to an open-ended question that this brand-new service brought them peace of mind during adverse circumstances. \"Tech TAs gave me confidence that everything during my Zoom lessons would run as smoothly as possible,\" they said.\nPenn State students serve as Tech TAs and are the Zoom technology experts during the synchronous portion of a class. Examples of their work in Zoom during the spring semester included; setting up breakout rooms, tracking students' attendance, administering polls, monitoring the chat feature, synchronous tech support, and recording sessions.\nAdditionally, the Tech TAs can help configure Zoom so that students cannot enter a 'room' unless the host is present. This will prevent faculty from receiving emails anytime someone enters their Zoom room, and it will help eliminate excessively long recordings.\nFaculty can request the help of a Tech TA by completing this Tech TA faculty request form. Upon submission, an email will be sent that introduces the instructor and the Tech TA. After the intro email, the TA will follow up directly to assess specific needs and determine the next steps.",

    "summary": "New York City's thriving tech sector has become a crucial source of middle-class jobs. But too few of those jobs are accessible to New Yorkers without a college degree and work experience, which means thousands are being left out of the boom.\n\nTo help more residents access these powerful opportunities, New York will have to build much stronger pathways into tech employment — and tech apprenticeship should be part of the solution.\n\nMany still believe apprenticeships are only meant for the building trades. But a large number of middle-skill positions in tech could be ideal for apprenticeships, which are a proven model for helping people without college degrees or previous work experience to succeed in challenging careers.\n\nFrom digital advertising and e-commerce to financial services and health care, employers see growing demand for a stronger local pipeline of tech talent. Apprenticeship can help meet those needs while vastly expanding access to tech careers for New Yorkers from low-income communities.\n\nBut despite the enormous promise of the model for launching tech careers, despite the presence of dozens of educational institutions and corporations that would be ideally suited to create such programs, new research from the Center for an Urban Future finds that New York City is home to fewer than 15 tech apprenticeship programs today, reaching no more than a few dozen people each year.\n\nThis is a surprisingly, unacceptably small figure for a city with more than 9,000 tech start-ups and 300,000 tech jobs.\n\nThe good news is that a handful of companies in New York both large and small are demonstrating the potential of tech apprenticeship. The transatlantic bank Barclays has trained and hired more than 50 apprentices in New York for tech jobs, partnering with the nonprofit skills-building organization Per Scholas to provide pre-apprenticeship tech training. Other new programs have taken root at companies like Spotify, Foursquare, IBM, 2U and Stack Overflow.\n\nThese are promising developments, but New York can make a lot more progress.\n\nIn fact, other regions have shown that it is possible to take bigger leaps into tech apprenticeships. For instance, Seattle's Apprenti program, launched in 2016, has served more than 700 tech apprentices so far at companies including Microsoft and Amazon. With graduates earning a median salary of $84,000 in a wide variety of tech occupations, Apprenti has expanded beyond Seattle and into Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Nashville and several other cities.\n\nNew York, which boasts the nation's second-largest tech sector, has the potential to reach even greater scale. Indeed, the city should set a bold goal of creating 1,000 new tech apprenticeship positions by 2025 — and make the expansion of apprenticeships a key part of its strategy to develop New York into the nation's most inclusive tech hub.\n\nThere's a lot that policymakers, employers and training providers will need to do to achieve this goal. Mayor de Blasio should start by using his platform to enlist more employers to launch apprenticeships. Without their buy-in, it'll be difficult to grow the model. His administration should work closely with tech companies and support local tech training providers to craft programs that address employers' talent needs and operate at the speed of the industry. And it should significantly scale up the one city-run model that appears to be working, the Tech Talent Pipeline's apprenticeship-like program for associate engineers.\n\nThe city might also recruit intermediaries that have expertise developing effective apprenticeships elsewhere, like Apprenti, and help get those programs off the ground by funding a portion of the pre-apprenticeship training and education that prepares workers for on-the-job learning.\n\nBut ultimately, more of the city's tech companies will need to step up to the plate and exercise their own initiative.\n\nThere's a lot New York City needs to do to expand access to the good jobs being created in tech. Apprenticeships are one strong place to start.",

    "summary": "The rise of big tech and how it will impact startupsShare this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email ShareIf there was ever a doubt about the abuse of power by big tech companies, their appearance in front of the US Congress has ended such doubts about the abusive nature of these companies. Revelations by the long-running antitrust investigation show that everyone in business who has been dealing with big tech should be concerned. African Tech startups with a potential for global reach should be more concerned. It is almost impossible to operate in the tech space and reach a global market without using either the Apple App Store, Amazon AWS, and other platforms owned by big tech companies. One factor that stood out during the hearings is that there's unequal treatment of companies on the App Store by Apple. One document that was presented during the hearings showed how Amazon Prime was paying fewer fees to Apple for its presence on the App store. This is just one example that shows unfair treatment by the global giant, Apple. If a similar service by an African startup were to exist on the App store it would have a lesser chance of success in terms of revenue earned on the App store. Acquisitions are another area that should concern many African tech startups. Naturally being acquired by a global tech company excites tech founders who dream of scaling their products. Based on recent revelations and what has been known about big tech companies, African tech founders should adopt a different view of acquisitions by big tech companies.The story of how and why Facebook acquired Instagram should serve as a lesson for many who dream of being acquired by big tech companies.It's a known fact that Kevin Systrom, Instagram founder, had a tough time within Facebook after the app was acquired. We now know that the strategy was always about killing the enemy by acquisition. The same happened to WhatsApp. Facebook is currently working on integrating all these acquired products under Facebook while they maintain their identity. It's also important to note that the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram are no longer within Facebook and left the company extremely unhappy. The lesson here is that being acquired by big tech is not always what it looks like. The behaviour of big tech companies is something that should not only concern leading tech startups. Even small guys who are just trying to sell a unique product on Amazon should be concerned. The testimony about Amazon showed how the tech company cannibalizes the very entrepreneurs that sell their products on Amazon by creating similar goods thereby competing or removing them completely. The moral of the story here is that Africa should figure out a way to stand on its own. Reliance on global tech platforms will not lead to global tech entities that are Africa owned.As long as big tech continues on this trajectory every promising startup will be gobbled and stopped on its tracks by global giants.The big tech is currently under scrutiny not just in the US. Recently regulators in Australia have accused Alphabet's Google of misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising, seeking a fine 'in the millions. In Africa, however, big tech has been enjoying a free ride.As African regulators are doing nothing about big tech, African tech startups should find ways of protecting themselves against falls acquisitions and cloning by big tech.*Wesley Diphoko is the Editor-In-Chief of Fast Company (SA) magazine.This article was originally published in Fast Company.",

    "excerpt": "We're more reliant on tech than ever. How will the industry adapt to that?",
    "summary": "This year started off with Democratic nominee candidates centering discussions around breaking up Big Tech—conversations that soon took a back seat due to the pandemic. But we're reliant on tech now more than ever, Anne-Marie Slaughter, the CEO of New America, said during Tuesday's Future Tense event 'Will 2020 Change American Tech?' The pandemic has us more dependent on large tech companies like Amazon; contact tracing apps could play an important role in helping contain the spread of the coronavirus; a major switch to telework has potentially changed the way many of our jobs function in the long term. The year thus far has been a 'roller coaster,' Slaughter said, and it's only half over. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, a partner at Greylock Partners, and a board member at New America, said the tech industry undoubtedly needs to improve if it is to function as a tool for the betterment of society. But he also thinks that technology can play a role in solving problems like racial injustices, the climate crisis, and other issues. So when the techlash becomes somewhat 'anti-technology,' that poses a 'serious problem.' Instead of focusing on ways to limit tech companies, he said, people should ask, 'How do we make [technology] better for American democracy, American society, American values for the world? And what [are] the ways that we interact in order to make that happen?' But, Slaughter said, there is no real consensus as to what exactly defines American tech values. China—one of the biggest global tech competitors—has a surveillance-heavy relationship with tech and an almost 'authoritarian vision of what the internet is,' she said. The EU distinctly values the protection of privacy online and often errs on the side of caution. Slaughter said the American tech space needs to create 'our own distinctive American vision' of what the internet looks like 'that builds in privacy, equality, a measure of justice.' In the tech race with China, perhaps the winning recipe is a multitude of smaller companies thriving rather than a handful of large companies dominating the space, Slaughter suggested. She argued that Zoom's nearly overnight skyrocket to success amid a workforce going digital illustrates that point—a small company did better even though Google and Microsoft had infinitely more resources. Those who push for antitrust regulation in tech must embrace two truths about the industry, Hoffman said. First, 'this is not an American-run universe anymore.' When having these conversations about Big Tech, it's crucial to take into account how the other global players handle the same situations. Is China going to break up its largest tech corporations? Probably not, Hoffman said. Second, he said, American tech is heading from five-plus major tech corporations to 10, not down to two or three. The competition between the current companies in Big Tech 'creates lots of space—not just in the competition between the large firms themselves—but for startups,' and some of those startups will eventually become tech powerhouses themselves instead of being eaten up by the current players. The influence of these major tech companies goes far beyond the marketplace of ideas, however, especially in a year experiencing 'twin pandemics' of coronavirus and racial injustice, Slaughter said. From algorithmic biases—like in a recent case involving facial recognition software—to a vast disparity between tech jobs depending on race, big tech plays a major role in racial injustice as well. The far-reaching level of influence tech has on day-to-day lives means harmful software can 'institutionalize racism across the entire country,' he said. And in the same way, better software could be a critical anti-racist tool in society. 'If you want to be deploying software systems that have economic impact or social justice impact, you need to proactively prove that you are good on the civil rights vectors,' Hoffman said. Tech needs to go beyond anti-bias training and diversity hiring, he said. The industry has to check itself in a way that ensures inclusion and is actively anti-racist. Another impactful way tech companies could work against racial injustice is by distributing financial resources to BIPOC-owned tech operations and individuals in the tech space, Hoffman said. It's the most American of solutions—ownership of property is a core value. Making people who are disadvantaged in tech literal 'co-owners' of society will help close the gap, he said, and prioritizing financial institutions that help the Black community is crucial. Looking 25 years into the future, the twin pandemics could leave a lasting legacy. America has the ability to become the global tech hub within that time period, Hoffman said—but on one condition. He said if the country continues to systemically prevent immigration, then there's little hope for a thriving tech community. Immigration is the country's 'superpower,' Hoffman said.  Without it, American tech doesn't stand a chance.

    "summary": "New York City's thriving tech sector has become a crucial source of middle-class jobs. But too few of those jobs are accessible to New Yorkers without a college degree and work experience, which means thousands are being left out of the boom.\n\nTo help more residents access these powerful opportunities, New York will have to build much stronger pathways into tech employment — and tech apprenticeship should be part of the solution.\n\nMany still believe apprenticeships are only meant for the building trades. But a large number of middle-skill positions in tech could be ideal for apprenticeships, which are a proven model for helping people without college degrees or previous work experience to succeed in challenging careers.\n\nFrom digital advertising and e-commerce to financial services and health care, employers see growing demand for a stronger local pipeline of tech talent. Apprenticeship can help meet those needs while vastly expanding access to tech careers for New Yorkers from low-income communities.\n\nBut despite the enormous promise of the model for launching tech careers, despite the presence of dozens of educational institutions and corporations that would be ideally suited to create such programs, new research from the Center for an Urban Future finds that New York City is home to fewer than 15 tech apprenticeship programs today, reaching no more than a few dozen people each year.\n\nThis is a surprisingly, unacceptably small figure for a city with more than 9,000 tech start-ups and 300,000 tech jobs.\n\nThe good news is that a handful of companies in New York both large and small are demonstrating the potential of tech apprenticeship. The transatlantic bank Barclays has trained and hired more than 50 apprentices in New York for tech jobs, partnering with the nonprofit skills-building organization Per Scholas to provide pre-apprenticeship tech training. Other new programs have taken root at companies like Spotify, Foursquare, IBM, 2U and Stack Overflow.\n\nThese are promising developments, but New York can make a lot more progress.\n\nIn fact, other regions have shown that it is possible to take bigger leaps into tech apprenticeships. For instance, Seattle's Apprenti program, launched in 2016, has served more than 700 tech apprentices so far at companies including Microsoft and Amazon. With graduates earning a median salary of $84,000 in a wide variety of tech occupations, Apprenti has expanded beyond Seattle and into Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Nashville and several other cities.\n\nNew York, which boasts the nation's second-largest tech sector, has the potential to reach even greater scale. Indeed, the city should set a bold goal of creating 1,000 new tech apprenticeship positions by 2025 — and make the expansion of apprenticeships a key part of its strategy to develop New York into the nation's most inclusive tech hub.\n\nThere's a lot that policymakers, employers and training providers will need to do to achieve this goal. Mayor de Blasio should start by using his platform to enlist more employers to launch apprenticeships. Without their buy-in, it'll be difficult to grow the model. His administration should work closely with tech companies and support local tech training providers to craft programs that address employers' talent needs and operate at the speed of the industry. And it should significantly scale up the one city-run model that appears to be working, the Tech Talent Pipeline's apprenticeship-like program for associate engineers.\n\nThe city might also recruit intermediaries that have expertise developing effective apprenticeships elsewhere, like Apprenti, and help get those programs off the ground by funding a portion of the pre-apprenticeship training and education that prepares workers for on-the-job learning.\n\nBut ultimately, more of the city's tech companies will need to step up to the plate and exercise their own initiative.\n\nThere's a lot New York City needs to do to expand access to the good jobs being created in tech. Apprenticeships are one strong place to start.",

    "summary": "The negative impact of traditional water softeners on sanitation districts and the environment have led to water softener bans in counties throughout the U.S. While a salt-based water softener removes calcium and magnesium from a home's water—thereby reducing the buildup of scale in the plumbing system and water heater—it replaces those minerals with sodium and chloride. The softening process produces as much as 150 gallons of brine solution a week, which requires discharging one to three times per week and puts a strain on sanitation districts––often resulting in a costlier treatment process.\nFlow-Tech Home's proprietary technology has the unique ability to treat all the water in a plumbing system, regardless of flow.

The Hang Seng Tech Index tracking tech giants listed in Hong Kong was launched on Monday as the world's top fund-raising center is striving to attract more tech firms and reinforce its position amid global volatility. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)\nHONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hang Seng Tech Index tracking tech giants listed in Hong Kong was launched on Monday as the world's top fund-raising center is striving to attract more tech firms and reinforce its position amid global volatility.\nThe new index of Hang Seng Indexes Company closed 1.28 percent lower to 6,774.78 points on its debut.\nThe tech index follows the performance of the 30 largest Hong Kong-traded tech firms in sectors including Internet, financial technology and e-commerce. Internet conglomerate Alibaba, making its secondary listing in Hong Kong last November, has the biggest weighting of 8.53 percent in the index, followed by Tencent and Meituan Dianping.\nThe launch of the tech index came as tech firms have started to play an increasingly bigger role on Hong Kong's stock market.\nThe number of tech companies listed on the main board of the Hong Kong exchange has increased from 137 at the end of 2017 to 163 in June 2020. The share by market capitalization of tech companies have also risen from 14.6 percent to 33.2 percent from 2017 to June 2020.\nTrading of tech shares has become robust on the market as a growing number of investors have started to favor tech firms, said Vincent Kwan, chief executive officer of Hang Seng Indexes Company.\nGiven the changing market landscape, the new index will better reflect the performance of top Hong Kong-listed technology companies.\nHang Seng Indexes Company also said the tech index will become the next flagship index of the company, alongside the broader Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.\nKwan also expects the index to become an international index after more global leading tech firms opt to go public in Hong Kong in the future.\nHong Kong's appeal to tech firms is attributable to a bold reform on listing rules of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) in 2018, which features lower thresholds for bio-tech companies and approval of weighted voting rights structures.\nThe reform has encouraged more promising tech firms to raise funds in Hong Kong and provided a major boost for the fund-raising market to stay prosperous.\nAnalysts believe the Hong Kong market can also wean off its reliance on traditional industries, including finance and property, and make a shift to the new economy.\nMore tech firms eager to list in Hong Kong and more investors turning to Hong Kong have helped form the current technology and finance circle here, Kwan said, adding that the new index, along with the market development, will propel Hong Kong for the tech sector.\nCurrently, more U.S.-traded Chinese mainland companies are expected to choose Hong Kong as the destination of their secondary listing. Alibaba, JD.com and NetEase have all completed their fund-raising in Hong Kong.\nAnt Group, the parent company of China's leading mobile-payment business Alipay, also announced earlier this month that it has commenced the process of concurrent initial public offerings in Shanghai and Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange topped the world's IPO league table for a second straight year in 2019 and for the seventh time in the last 11 years, with 312.89 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 40 billion U.S. dollars) raised.

    "summary": "June 26, 2020 03:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time LIMASSOL, Cyprus--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sergey Portnov, CEO of Parimatch, took to the virtual stage yesterday at Collision at Home – a global virtual conference which brings together tech leaders and high-potential start-ups to discuss the issues affecting the tech industry.\n\n \nDuring his speech, Sergey Portnov captivated Collison at Home's 30,000 strong audience with his experience of transforming Parimatch from a physical bookmaker into a leading international tech and entertainment brand, giving viewers his top five tips on tech transformation.\n\n\nOn transforming into a tech business, Sergey Portnov said:\n\n\n'At Parimatch we are obsessed with technology. We are a business built by businesspeople with management backgrounds, but now we have taken a major step to becoming a tech business – an endless journey with no destination.\n\n\n'Tech can either be used as a tool, or can be used to describe a culture, a mindset. Previously at Parimatch, we used tech as a tool, but not anymore. Tech isn't something which can be outsourced, it has to flow through your DNA. Only once you have this tech culture ingrained in your business will your company start to move ahead.'\n\n\nSergey's top five tips on tech transformation:\n\n\nLesson 1 – Accept the sacrifice\n\n\n'In the journey to tech transformation, you need to accept that you will lose things along the way. You may lose employees, customers, partners, maybe even revenue. Whilst this can be painful, this loss has to be accepted in order to transform and ultimately become stronger.'\n\n\nLesson 2 – Hire the best\n\n\n'Don't take the easy approach when it comes to hiring talent. We all know that it is people who make (or break) a business. Invest in the best people, and pay them a lot. People should be a serious financial investment. But don't just pay them well, give them freedom in their role. Motivate them, and give them time to shine.'\n\n\nLesson 3 – Speed is of the essence \n\n\n'For me, tech means speed. Every aspect of a tech business needs to be working at speed. The sports and betting industry are very fast paced, so we are able to surround our brand with that speedy energy. Be audacious and brave, create a culture of speed.'\n\n\nLesson 4 – Build company culture \n\n\n'We are continually working on how to foster loyalty from our existing employees. We work with all of our people and spend time building culture and values. These aren't just words on paper, we live them and people can see them in our actions. Values need to be authentic, and are essential to building a positive culture, and need to form the backbone of a business.'\n\n\nLesson 5 – Balance experience with ambition\n\n\n'It is important to balance experience with ambition. When one outweighs the other, it causes problems. We were ambitious with little experience once upon a time, we made mistakes and learnt from them. On the other hand, you have businesses with lots of experience but no ambition, they have become complacent and are not likely to last into the future. The ideal balance is 51% ambition and 49% experience.'\n\n\nA recording of Sergey Portnov's speech can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ98g1U-doU&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n-ENDS-\n\n\nABOUT PARIMATCH\n\n\nParimatch brings together technology, business and sport to deliver seamless entertainment powered by innovation. Founded in 1994, Parimatch has grown to become one of the largest betting companies in Europe and the CIS, and continues to explore new markets to enter. The business operates with a digital first mindset, and is constantly developing and improving the quality of its customer experience, which is enjoyed in 60 countries across the world. Parimatch's winning team of brand ambassadors include Conor McGregor, Mike Tyson, Petr Yan and the Shevchenko sisters. Parimatch is also the title sponsor of the popular esports team Virtus.pro, and is the exclusive betting partner to UFC in the CIS region.\n\n\nABOUT COLLISION \n\n\nCollision is 'America's fastest growing tech conference' created by the team behind Web Summit. In five years, Collision has grown from 2,500 to an expected 25,000 attendees from more than 120 countries. Attendees include CEOs of both the world's fastest growing startups and the world's largest companies, alongside leading investors and media.",

    "excerpt": "Tech TAs are available through the summer to assist Penn State faculty with delivering their courses over Zoom.",
    "summary": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Less than two weeks after Penn State transitioned to remote teaching, the Tech TAs program debuted to provide faculty real-time, on-demand Zoom support so they could focus on delivering lessons and not video-conferencing technology. Thanks to a positive reception and the continuation of remote teaching, Tech TAs will be available during summer courses.\nIn an anonymous survey of faculty who utilized Tech TAs during the spring semester, 100% of respondents indicated that they would recommend the service to a colleague and that Tech TAs added value to their courses. Additionally, over 90% of respondents mentioned they would use Tech TAs again, and that they helped to meet their students' needs.\nOne survey respondent replied to an open-ended question that this brand-new service brought them peace of mind during adverse circumstances. \"Tech TAs gave me confidence that everything during my Zoom lessons would run as smoothly as possible,\" they said.\nPenn State students serve as Tech TAs and are the Zoom technology experts during the synchronous portion of a class. Examples of their work in Zoom during the spring semester included; setting up breakout rooms, tracking students' attendance, administering polls, monitoring the chat feature, synchronous tech support, and recording sessions.\nAdditionally, the Tech TAs can help configure Zoom so that students cannot enter a 'room' unless the host is present. This will prevent faculty from receiving emails anytime someone enters their Zoom room, and it will help eliminate excessively long recordings.\nFaculty can request the help of a Tech TA by completing this Tech TA faculty request form. Upon submission, an email will be sent that introduces the instructor and the Tech TA. After the intro email, the TA will follow up directly to assess specific needs and determine the next steps.",

    "summary": "Harvard Business Review had deemed it 'The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.' But the demand for data scientists is rapidly cooling.In the past week, the number of US job postings for data scientists was down 43% from last year, according to the job-postings site Indeed. That's more than double the rate of decline this past week for job postings overall.The disappearance of data-scientist job openings has been especially drastic outside of the US tech hubs, where postings were 51% below year-ago levels. In tech hubs, postings were down 37%. According to Indeed, this pattern can be found across all tech jobs, and may be evidence that big tech companies, which generally are located in tech hubs like New York, San Francisco, and Seattle, have more resources to ride out the crisis.Postings for US tech jobs began to evaporate almost immediately after the first lockdowns began, but perhaps signaling that the tech industry's transition to remote work was smoother than most, the slump was not as severe as the decline in job postings overall.As the pandemic drags on, however, the market for tech-job seekers is not bouncing back as quickly as the market for job hunters in other sectors.While overall job posting trends this week were down 21% from last year, tech jobs have been down 36% from last year for weeks.IT operations and help desk jobs were down 32%, better than tech jobs overall. Software development jobs were down 35%. Even postings for jobs in artificial intelligence, a subgroup of software development, are down 29% since last year—more evidence that the pandemic has affected even the most cutting-edge tech jobs.",

    "summary": "The rise of big tech and how it will impact startupsShare this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email ShareIf there was ever a doubt about the abuse of power by big tech companies, their appearance in front of the US Congress has ended such doubts about the abusive nature of these companies. Revelations by the long-running antitrust investigation show that everyone in business who has been dealing with big tech should be concerned. African Tech startups with a potential for global reach should be more concerned. It is almost impossible to operate in the tech space and reach a global market without using either the Apple App Store, Amazon AWS, and other platforms owned by big tech companies. One factor that stood out during the hearings is that there's unequal treatment of companies on the App Store by Apple. One document that was presented during the hearings showed how Amazon Prime was paying fewer fees to Apple for its presence on the App store. This is just one example that shows unfair treatment by the global giant, Apple. If a similar service by an African startup were to exist on the App store it would have a lesser chance of success in terms of revenue earned on the App store. Acquisitions are another area that should concern many African tech startups. Naturally being acquired by a global tech company excites tech founders who dream of scaling their products. Based on recent revelations and what has been known about big tech companies, African tech founders should adopt a different view of acquisitions by big tech companies.The story of how and why Facebook acquired Instagram should serve as a lesson for many who dream of being acquired by big tech companies.It's a known fact that Kevin Systrom, Instagram founder, had a tough time within Facebook after the app was acquired. We now know that the strategy was always about killing the enemy by acquisition. The same happened to WhatsApp. Facebook is currently working on integrating all these acquired products under Facebook while they maintain their identity. It's also important to note that the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram are no longer within Facebook and left the company extremely unhappy. The lesson here is that being acquired by big tech is not always what it looks like. The behaviour of big tech companies is something that should not only concern leading tech startups. Even small guys who are just trying to sell a unique product on Amazon should be concerned. The testimony about Amazon showed how the tech company cannibalizes the very entrepreneurs that sell their products on Amazon by creating similar goods thereby competing or removing them completely. The moral of the story here is that Africa should figure out a way to stand on its own. Reliance on global tech platforms will not lead to global tech entities that are Africa owned.As long as big tech continues on this trajectory every promising startup will be gobbled and stopped on its tracks by global giants.The big tech is currently under scrutiny not just in the US. Recently regulators in Australia have accused Alphabet's Google of misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising, seeking a fine 'in the millions. In Africa, however, big tech has been enjoying a free ride.As African regulators are doing nothing about big tech, African tech startups should find ways of protecting themselves against falls acquisitions and cloning by big tech.*Wesley Diphoko is the Editor-In-Chief of Fast Company (SA) magazine.This article was originally published in Fast Company.",

The three-year pilot scheme will run on a budget of £8 million (Bt314.3 million) and aims to support tech businesses as they seek to internationalise. The scheme also aims meet growing demand for digital tech solutions after Covid-19 – from improving supply chain resilience to managing expanded e-commerce. 'Digital technology is more important than ever, delivering innovations that improve people's lives and make businesses more productive – as we've seen through the Covid-19 pandemic, ' said UK Trade Commissioner for Asia Pacific, Natalie Black. 'Strengthening the UK's partnership with Asia Pacific through this new Digital Trade Network will allow us to create new collaborations, driving trade and investment and ensuring we all benefit from the best global digital innovation.' Tech Nation – the UK tech scale-up experts – will join the Digital Trade Network by extending their successful Entrepreneur Engagement Network internationally – in Japan, Singapore and Australia. The network will support tech scale ups in Asia Pacific interested in the UK market, by providing a direct link to key tech clusters across the country. The UK is a world-leader in tech and digital, attracting more than £10 billion worth of investment in 2019, ranking third only behind the US and China. Meanwhile, 79 tech unicorns have been developed in the UK in recent years – more than Germany, France and Israel combined. - The Nation/Asia News Network",

    "summary": "For many cities, tech hubs have been a key to jump starting economic growth in the wake of the global financial crisis. In an era of uncertainty, tech-sector growth is proving to be a driving force for nations attempting to reach into the 'next economy'. In the UK, for instance, the sector is – optimistically – predicted to grow four times faster than GDP, while tech job growth is expected to outperform all other occupation categories by 2020.By traditional measures of a successful economy – jobs and wages – this is a welcome development. But there is a growing body of evidence which suggests that the growth of the tech sector in cities is associated with increased economic segregation. And while it's true that, in general, large, successful, high-growth cities tend to have high rates of economic segregation, areas with tech hubs seem to experience this effect more markedly.Broadening the benefitsStudies have found that the share of tech jobs a city has is positively associated with income inequality: so, the higher the proportion of tech employment in a city, the more unequal it is. In short, pessimistic analyses suggest that a technology-driven economy greatly favors a small group of talented and lucky individuals, while bringing little benefit to others.Soaring costs in San Fran. from www.shutterstock.comThis trend is being borne out in international tech hubs. Tech growth in San Francisco's Bay Area has driven property prices to levels far out of kilter with the average local salary, and is pricing out smaller firms. Meanwhile, in London, tech growth has increased the cost of living in parts of the city. Coupled with a shortage of housing options and office space, this has led to both smaller firms and households being displaced from central areas.The gentrification of formerly industrial areas has been a particular issue in recent years. The introduction of permitted development rights has placed the need for new homes in direct competition with the demand for business space. But now, a new report from the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) argues that this need not be the case.The impact that tech enterprises have on a city is grounded in the choices we make as a society. The question is: as the tech industry grows, how can we increase the opportunities on offer, for the greatest number of people?Wider opportunitiesThe marked growth of the tech sector and its resources – and the profitability of many tech firms – means that there is more that these businesses can to do address the challenges facing local economies where they are based. Local and national governments have an important role to play in all this. Pursuing a tech growth agenda may well lead to overall gains. But policy makers must combine this agenda with efforts to ensure that these gains are shared, if they are to address longer-term city challenges.The RTPI report argues that cities experiencing tech sector growth, and the infrastructure challenges that go with it, cannot simply rely on existing planning and tax obligations. Instead, authorities should put together a clear city technology plan, which takes the potential for wider benefits of tech sector growth into account.Such a plan could clearly lay out the longer-term challenges faced by the city and possible alignments that exist between tech firms' resources and public policy challenges. Not all tech growth involves new development, and many of the potential benefits are social rather than financial in nature. And measures can be taken to secure these benefits, rather than simply hoping tech growth will naturally spillover to the local economy.Getting glassy. uncoolbob/Flickr, CC BY-NCOne obvious solution is to up-skill the local community. One of the biggest problems facing the tech sector is a shortage of coders and software developers. Many tech firms' city centre locations place them close to relatively deprived communities, so why not make the local community tech literate, in order to deliver the skills tech firms need? For instance, Hackney Community College in London has started an apprenticeship scheme with local tech firms, to both grow the local skills base, and help meet the demands of the sector.Another option is to collaborate with tech firms in urban regeneration projects. Tech firms and employees display a preference for easily accessible, walkable, multi-use districts. This provides a clear opportunity to reconfigure urban areas. In some cities, previously industrial districts are undergoing physical transformations, alongside economic ones. Well planned regeneration projects will make use of consultations to involve the views of the local community. This is a crucial part of the process, in order to avoid displacing local residents and businesses.Finally, local governments can employ a team to engage with the sector. In order to attract and harness the growth of the tech sector, it is crucial to get a sense of what these firms want from the city. Dublin's commissioner for startups and Amsterdam's chief technology officer are two newly devised roles that provide interesting models in this context.The tech sector is likely to continue growing well into the future. Yet the benefits are not always shared. But there's huge potential for mutual economic and social support between a city and its tech sector. This potential should be nurtured into a collaborative relationship, which achieves economic growth that everyone can benefit from.This article is republished from The Conversation by Neil Lee, Assistant Professor of Economic Geography, London School of Economics and Political Science under a Creative Commons license.

China unveiled a guideline on the quality development of national high-tech zones in July, stressing efforts in spurring innovation, deepening reform, and expanding opening-up in this sector. Xu said after more than 30 years' development, national high-tech zones have become an important support for the country's economy. In 2019, China's 169 national high-tech zones created 12.2 trillion yuan in output and paid 1.9 trillion yuan in taxes and fees, accounting for 12.3 percent of China's GDP and 11.8 percent of the country's tax revenue. The R&D expenditure of enterprises in the national high-tech zones totaled 825.9 billion yuan, accounting for half the R&D expenditure of enterprises in the country in 2019. The number of invention patents authorized in national high-tech zones accounted for 37.5 percent of the country's total. By the end of 2019, national high-tech zones housed 81,000 high-tech enterprises, accounting for 35.9 percent of the country's total. China's high-tech zones have nurtured innovative companies with international influence, and developed a number of world-class industrial clusters in the fields of photovoltaic electricity, wind power and new energy vehicles, Xu said.",

    "summary": "San Francisco Bay Area tech workers are growing apprehensive about the stability of their jobs.A new survey by job-search database Hired that evaluated 2,300 tech workers found that 53% of employees in the tech sector in the Bay Area say they're \"concerned\" or \"very concerned\" that they'll be laid off or furloughed in the next six months. Hired also surveyed tech employees in other regions, finding that 42% of New York respondents and 36% of UK respondents were also concerned about losing their jobs. Hired theorized that tech workers in the Bay Area are so concerned due to the region's high concentration of venture-backed companies, which may be more vulnerable in the face of an economic downtown. The coronavirus outbreak, which hit the Bay Area hard in early March, has impacted several tech companies and startups in the area. Uber, LinkedIn, Airbnb, and Lyft have all laid off employees since March, and several venture-backed tech startups have furloughed or laid off workers in the last few months.  In June, a report from tech firm Visier, which helps companies analyze and optimize their workforces, found that tech has been impacted by the coronavirus crisis in a different way from other industries. Visier found that the big tech companies, many of which are based in the Bay Area, made bigger job cuts and started laying off workers sooner than companies in other industries.The study also showed that tech firms continued cutting jobs at high rates after companies in other industries mostly stopped laying off workers. Given that employee expenses, including payroll, tend to make up a significant portion of tech companies' costs, those companies are looking to cut some of those costs during the downturn, Ian Cook, Visier's vice president of people solutions, told Business Insider last month. \"High tech is highly dependent on people,\" Cook said. \"We know that they're always quick and careful to manage that cost base.\"",

    "excerpt": "The third annual Diversity in Tech Awards (DITA), in partnership with Microsoft For Startups, takes place virtually on November 10th, 2020",
    "summary": "Technology and inclusion are set to be celebrated at this year's Diversity in Tech Awards (DITA), with organisers calling for entries for those behind reshaping a futuristic billion euro industry. Previously known as the Women in Tech awards, DITA will shine the spotlight on the achievements of companies creating a more diverse workplace while striving to narrow the gender gap in the technology sector. It will boast 18 categories with an equal number for both diversity and women in tech. More than 270 companies and 368 individuals were nominated last year as part of the Women in Tech awards, which included three diversity-focused categories for the first time. The new additions to the competition were in recognition of the growing need to tackle diversity across the tech ecosystem. This year's awards are expected to attract a larger international audience of leading tech executives, VIPs, government representatives and nominees, all of whom play major roles within the thriving international tech community. 2019 Winners of the Women in Tech Award (now the Diversity in Tech Awards) In recognising the broad efforts of promoting diversity in the workplace, the awards have been split into two category areas. The Women in Tech categories include a focus on tech leadership, entrepreneurship, digital transformation, mentorship and data science. There will also be a special recognition award for women who have their mark in innovation, which is named after pioneering US computer scientist Grace Hopper. Hopper was one of the first programmers to work on the Harvard Mark 1, the world's first electromechanical computer. Attendees at the 2019 awards ceremony Due to the unstoppable nature of Ireland's techpreneurs, the Diversity in Tech categories have increased from three to nine categories this year. They include awards for role models in tech, LGBTQ+ inclusion, social mobility, disability inclusion, cultural inclusion, generational inclusion and health and wellness. An overall International Company of the Year and Special Recognition Award have also been added to the broad spectrum of cutting edge categories. Speaking about the event and the emphasis on inclusion, managing director of Dublin Tech Summit and organiser of the Diversity in Tech Awards, Tracey Carney says: 'We're delighted to announce our third edition of the newly rebranded Diversity in Tech Awards. Tracey Carney, managing director of Dublin Tech Summit 'This year will be the biggest yet with a view to expanding the scope of the awards in recognition of the growing importance of wider diversity in the workplace. Having received significant interest in previous years we decided to reposition the awards entirely to capture the range of diversity and inclusion initiatives we have seen across the industry. This year we've balanced both women in tech and diversity in tech by restructuring our entire format to bring the event virtually. We're excited to welcome our headline sponsor Microsoft for Startups as we expand our diversity awards and acknowledge the best that the Irish and international tech scene has to offer.'  Speaking about Microsoft for Startups partnership, managing director of Western Europe, Andrew Macadam says: 'Microsoft's mission is all about empowering every person and company on the planet to achieve more and this partnership is totally aligned with empowering people that are making a real impact and progress to encompass D&I in their culture.  Andrew Macadam, managing director, Western Europe, Microsoft for Startups. 'The most successful companies are ones that embed diversity and inclusiveness into their culture from the start. Our role is to support B2B startups that are looking to scale and grow and become world leaders, and we recognise that great companies can come from anywhere, regardless of their background.  'I see the Diversity in Tech Awards not only recognising, but amplifying the voices of founders and companies that are under-represented at the moment. These awards help everyone understand the opportunity and impact of a diverse and inclusive culture and we are excited to be working in partnership with them.' Internationally there has been strong progress in terms of workplace diversity, highlighted recently in the United States with the Supreme Court ruling preventing members of the LGBTQ+ being dismissed from the workplace because of sexual orientation or gender identity. With nominations now open for the awards, you can nominate inspiring businesses, individuals and leaders from within the tech community who are achieving change in a very tangible way and creating a more open, inclusive environment for all.  The awards are organised by the Dublin Tech Summit team. Nominations and tickets to the virtual event will be free to ensure the awards are as open and inclusive as possible. They will include world class keynote speakers, panels and fireside discussions. Nominations close on the 26th of August 2020. For more information, visit diversityintechawards.com",

    "title": "Will 2020 Change American Tech?",
    "author": "Mackinley Lutes-Adlhoch",

    "published_date_precision": "full",

    "clean_url": "slate.com",
    "excerpt": "We're more reliant on tech than ever. How will the industry adapt to that?",
    "summary": "This year started off with Democratic nominee candidates centering discussions around breaking up Big Tech—conversations that soon took a back seat due to the pandemic. But we're reliant on tech now more than ever, Anne-Marie Slaughter, the CEO of New America, said during Tuesday's Future Tense event 'Will 2020 Change American Tech?' The pandemic has us more dependent on large tech companies like Amazon; contact tracing apps could play an important role in helping contain the spread of the coronavirus; a major switch to telework has potentially changed the way many of our jobs function in the long term. The year thus far has been a 'roller coaster,' Slaughter said, and it's only half over. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, a partner at Greylock Partners, and a board member at New America, said the tech industry undoubtedly needs to improve if it is to function as a tool for the betterment of society. But he also thinks that technology can play a role in solving problems like racial injustices, the climate crisis, and other issues. So when the techlash becomes somewhat 'anti-technology,' that poses a 'serious problem.' Instead of focusing on ways to limit tech companies, he said, people should ask, 'How do we make [technology] better for American democracy, American society, American values for the world? And what [are] the ways that we interact in order to make that happen?' But, Slaughter said, there is no real consensus as to what exactly defines American tech values. China—one of the biggest global tech competitors—has a surveillance-heavy relationship with tech and an almost 'authoritarian vision of what the internet is,' she said. The EU distinctly values the protection of privacy online and often errs on the side of caution. Slaughter said the American tech space needs to create 'our own distinctive American vision' of what the internet looks like 'that builds in privacy, equality, a measure of justice.' In the tech race with China, perhaps the winning recipe is a multitude of smaller companies thriving rather than a handful of large companies dominating the space, Slaughter suggested. She argued that Zoom's nearly overnight skyrocket to success amid a workforce going digital illustrates that point—a small company did better even though Google and Microsoft had infinitely more resources. Those who push for antitrust regulation in tech must embrace two truths about the industry, Hoffman said. First, 'this is not an American-run universe anymore.' When having these conversations about Big Tech, it's crucial to take into account how the other global players handle the same situations. Is China going to break up its largest tech corporations? Probably not, Hoffman said. Second, he said, American tech is heading from five-plus major tech corporations to 10, not down to two or three. The competition between the current companies in Big Tech 'creates lots of space—not just in the competition between the large firms themselves—but for startups,' and some of those startups will eventually become tech powerhouses themselves instead of being eaten up by the current players. The influence of these major tech companies goes far beyond the marketplace of ideas, however, especially in a year experiencing 'twin pandemics' of coronavirus and racial injustice, Slaughter said. From algorithmic biases—like in a recent case involving facial recognition software—to a vast disparity between tech jobs depending on race, big tech plays a major role in racial injustice as well. The far-reaching level of influence tech has on day-to-day lives means harmful software can 'institutionalize racism across the entire country,' he said. And in the same way, better software could be a critical anti-racist tool in society. 'If you want to be deploying software systems that have economic impact or social justice impact, you need to proactively prove that you are good on the civil rights vectors,' Hoffman said. Tech needs to go beyond anti-bias training and diversity hiring, he said. The industry has to check itself in a way that ensures inclusion and is actively anti-racist. Another impactful way tech companies could work against racial injustice is by distributing financial resources to BIPOC-owned tech operations and individuals in the tech space, Hoffman said. It's the most American of solutions—ownership of property is a core value. Making people who are disadvantaged in tech literal 'co-owners' of society will help close the gap, he said, and prioritizing financial institutions that help the Black community is crucial. Looking 25 years into the future, the twin pandemics could leave a lasting legacy. America has the ability to become the global tech hub within that time period, Hoffman said—but on one condition. He said if the country continues to systemically prevent immigration, then there's little hope for a thriving tech community. Immigration is the country's 'superpower,' Hoffman said.  Without it, American tech doesn't stand a chance.

    "excerpt": "The UK stands to gain from US President Donald Trump's visa ban that will prevent foreign talent from setting up shop on American soil,",
    "summary": "The UK stands to gain from US President Donald Trump's visa ban that will prevent foreign talent from setting up shop on American soil, tech figures have told City A.M., providing new opportunities to entrepreneurs and highly-skilled workers. An executive order signed by Trump this week suspended foreign work permits such as the H1-B and L-1 visas, preventing companies from transferring staff to US offices and bringing in skilled talent from overseas. 'All of the talent that may have thought of going to the US now has been sent a pretty clear message,' co-founder of London venture capital giant Localglobe and early Skype executive Saul Klein said. 'But equally given the strength of the UK tech ecosystem, it's a great chance for the UK to put its best foot forward and explain why it's a great place to start and build a tech company.' Klein added that remote working policies set up during the pandemic means many UK firms can adjust to no longer physically staffing employees in the US. 'Everyone is going to be a lot more flexible as to where they place their workforce and if you shut your borders down to talent, it's pretty easy nowadays for people to site their talent outside of the US,' he said. 'It may provide some inconveniences in the short term, but for a lot of the UK's talent, they don't necessarily have to do that anymore.' The UK has established a number of new visa schemes to attract foreign tech workers, such as the Tech Nation Global Talent Visa and the Startup Visa introduced by former chancellor Sajid Javid. Gerard Grech, chief executive of Tech Nation, said he anticipates that the global talent visa will now see an increase in applications following the US' decision. 'Having been an H1-B visa holder myself, I think the US' decision to suspend the scheme is a setback for the US and its growing tech industry,' he said. 'The UK is very much open and active in attracting the best and brightest talent from around the world as the third-largest tech investment market, after the US and China.' Skilled people who previously travelled from the UK to the US to work for major tech companies are now slowly returning to Britain, as the cost of living and chances to enter a company at the ground level begin to dwindle in hotbeds such as San Francisco. 'The UK has long benefited from the return of skilled people who have worked in US-based software companies and now want to come back to Britain, a group of people we refer to as ‘Valley Veterans',' said Balderton Capital partner James Wise. 'With these recent changes to the US visa system, British-based technology companies have an even better chance of attracting people who may have otherwise gone to the US, which is essential for our already strong software expertise to remain competitive.'  Tech UK, a trade body that represents Britain's tech industry, said it would welcome all newcomers to the UK's burgeoning tech scene. British tech startups broke records again last year to rake in more than £10bn in investment. They have continued to grow, receiving more than $5.3bn (£4.3bn) in funding in the first half of 2020 despite coronavirus. 'The introduction of the Global Talent Visa and the planned reforms to Tier 2 send a strong signal that our door is open to the brightest minds in tech to help build the future we need,' said Tech UK's associate directory of policy, Vinous Ali. 'The UK digital sector is already growing faster than any other sector in the UK and this is creating the need for more skilled people from the UK but also the best talent from around the world,' she added.",

    "summary": "China's tech sector is close to surpassing the US to become the world's best-performing technology industry in 2020.Indeed, China's tech sector is catching up. Until now, the US comfortably led the world in recovering from (and thriving in) the coronavirus pandemic.US tech, represented by QQQ on the chart above (more on that later), was up 14% for the year as of Monday's market close. China's equivalent fund, CQQQ, had returned 13% in 2020 — just one percent difference.Data from NASDAQ, Financial Times. Chart made with Flourish.As for the rest of the world: Europe's tech sector has faired relatively well, up 5%. Tech companies hailing from emerging markets have had the toughest time, down 17% overall but still recovering (slowly).ETFs and indexes: how to benchmark (and invest in) the tech industryBuying stock in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) is a handy way of investing in a particular industry. Some ETFs are actively managed, meaning that actual humans buy and sell the underlying portfolio. Others use algorithms to track an index identically.Take Invesco QQQ: it's the world's biggest tech-focused ETF with more than $116 billion in assets under management. QQQ scales its investments to the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), a tech-heavy index that allocates weight according to a company's market value.[Read: Bitcoin vs. NASDAQ 100: Watch them thrive during the pandemic]QQQ's top stocks mirror the NDX's: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon together make up more than 30% of QQQ's investments, which are in proportion to their market cap and relative to the rest of the index.So, just as the rise and fall of the NDX details the health of US tech at large, so does the market performance of Invesco's QQQ.Here are the top stocks in China, Europe, and beyondHard Fork used Invesco's China Technology ETF (CQQQ) to represent China's booming tech sector. Similarly to the US alternative, CQQQ maps its portfolio to the FTSE China Incl A 25% Technology Capped Index, which consists of top (publicly investable) China-based tech firms.CQQQ's top stocks are Tencent, Meituan Dianping, and Baidu. Like QQQ, its portfolio is top heavy due to the size of its biggest tech companies, which make up more than 25% of the fund's portfolio.Tencent, like Amazon and Microsoft, has set price records this yearOver in Europe, iShares' EXV3 tracks the STOXX Europe 600 Technology index (SX8P), a benchmark for the wider European tech sector. Due to a relatively small industry, EXV3 is even more top heavy than its American and Chinese counterparts.Semiconductor magnates ASML, enterprise software mainstay SAP, and internet giant Prosus account for a knuckle-munching 48% of its total portfolio.As for the rest of the world, iShares' EXMC tracks MSCI's capitalization-weighted index of emerging markets (excluding China). EXMC invests in top tech companies from more than 20 countries including India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates.EXMC allows itself the ability to designate a portion of its assets to certain other investments. As such, EXMC's top holdings are an ETF that deals specifically in top Indian companies regardless of industry (13.45%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (7.52%), and South Korea's Samsung (5.95%).But while China and the US duke it out for number one, the world's emerging tech sectors are likely focused on simply breaking even for the year. At least they're headed in the right direction.",

    "summary": "The rise of big tech and how it will impact startupsShare this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email ShareIf there was ever a doubt about the abuse of power by big tech companies, their appearance in front of the US Congress has ended such doubts about the abusive nature of these companies. Revelations by the long-running antitrust investigation show that everyone in business who has been dealing with big tech should be concerned. African Tech startups with a potential for global reach should be more concerned. It is almost impossible to operate in the tech space and reach a global market without using either the Apple App Store, Amazon AWS, and other platforms owned by big tech companies. One factor that stood out during the hearings is that there's unequal treatment of companies on the App Store by Apple. One document that was presented during the hearings showed how Amazon Prime was paying fewer fees to Apple for its presence on the App store. This is just one example that shows unfair treatment by the global giant, Apple. If a similar service by an African startup were to exist on the App store it would have a lesser chance of success in terms of revenue earned on the App store. Acquisitions are another area that should concern many African tech startups. Naturally being acquired by a global tech company excites tech founders who dream of scaling their products. Based on recent revelations and what has been known about big tech companies, African tech founders should adopt a different view of acquisitions by big tech companies.The story of how and why Facebook acquired Instagram should serve as a lesson for many who dream of being acquired by big tech companies.It's a known fact that Kevin Systrom, Instagram founder, had a tough time within Facebook after the app was acquired. We now know that the strategy was always about killing the enemy by acquisition. The same happened to WhatsApp. Facebook is currently working on integrating all these acquired products under Facebook while they maintain their identity. It's also important to note that the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram are no longer within Facebook and left the company extremely unhappy. The lesson here is that being acquired by big tech is not always what it looks like. The behaviour of big tech companies is something that should not only concern leading tech startups. Even small guys who are just trying to sell a unique product on Amazon should be concerned. The testimony about Amazon showed how the tech company cannibalizes the very entrepreneurs that sell their products on Amazon by creating similar goods thereby competing or removing them completely. The moral of the story here is that Africa should figure out a way to stand on its own. Reliance on global tech platforms will not lead to global tech entities that are Africa owned.As long as big tech continues on this trajectory every promising startup will be gobbled and stopped on its tracks by global giants.The big tech is currently under scrutiny not just in the US. Recently regulators in Australia have accused Alphabet's Google of misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising, seeking a fine 'in the millions. In Africa, however, big tech has been enjoying a free ride.As African regulators are doing nothing about big tech, African tech startups should find ways of protecting themselves against falls acquisitions and cloning by big tech.*Wesley Diphoko is the Editor-In-Chief of Fast Company (SA) magazine.This article was originally published in Fast Company.",

    "summary": "China's high-tech zones maintain growth amid epidemicFrom:ChinaDaily   |  2020-07-24 15:58BEIJING - China's national high-tech zones have maintained growth despite the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, a senior official said on Thursday. In May, the revenue of high-tech zones reached 3.27 trillion yuan ($467 billion), up by 10.3 percent year-on-year, and the export volume reached 319 billion yuan, up by 13.7 percent year-on-year, said Xu Nanping, vice- minister of science and technology, at a press conference. With strong scientific and technological innovation capacity, the high-tech zones have shown resilience to risks and registered a higher growth than the national average, Xu said. In the first quarter of this year, the high-tech zones employed more than 26.56 million people, up by 2.1 percent year-on-year. A total of 508,000 new jobs were created in high-tech zones during that period, up by 6.7 percent year-on-year. China's national high-tech zones play a vital role in underpinning innovation-driven development and establishing valuable experience for China's high-quality economic development, Xu added. China unveiled a guideline on the quality development of national high-tech zones in July, stressing efforts in spurring innovation, deepening reform, and expanding opening-up in this sector. Xu said after more than 30 years' development, national high-tech zones have become an important support for the country's economy. In 2019, China's 169 national high-tech zones created 12.2 trillion yuan in output and paid 1.9 trillion yuan in taxes and fees, accounting for 12.3 percent of China's GDP and 11.8 percent of the country's tax revenue. The R&D expenditure of enterprises in the national high-tech zones totaled 825.9 billion yuan, accounting for half the R&D expenditure of enterprises in the country in 2019. The number of invention patents authorized in national high-tech zones accounted for 37.5 percent of the country's total. By the end of 2019, national high-tech zones housed 81,000 high-tech enterprises, accounting for 35.9 percent of the country's total. China's high-tech zones have nurtured innovative companies with international influence, and developed a number of world-class industrial clusters in the fields of photovoltaic electricity, wind power and new energy vehicles, Xu said.",

    "summary": "D-Tech International USA By bringing even more of our product manufacturing to the USA, and to Cape May County specifically, not only will our customers be assured of quality products built in-house by our American employees, D-Tech is able to make a significant investment in the local area RIO GRANDE, N.J. (PRWEB) June 09, 2020 D-Tech International USA has announced its new home, in the heart of Cape May County's new innovation hub for tech businesses. Since opening its US headquarters in the area business has been booming for D-Tech, which has enjoyed a 100% expansion since 2016. So, when the company was offered the opportunity to become an economic development partner of Cape May County, they were delighted to accept. In 2019, developers broke ground on the project labelled by Cape May County Freeholder Will Morey as, 'the start of a reimagining of Cape May County's economic future.' Fast forward to June 2020 and D-Tech has just completed its move into a 7,000-square-foot purpose-built manufacturing facility. Made in the USA This increase in D-Tech's manufacturing capacity was one of the driving factors behind the move. D-Tech had already transferred all manufacturing of PCBs from China to Cape May County, and moving to the new facility will enable the company to start manufacturing its holdIT self-service pickup locker solution in the region. Speaking about the move, Marvin Crisp, Founder and CEO of D-Tech International USA, said: 'By bringing even more of our product manufacturing to the USA, and to Cape May County specifically, not only will our customers be assured of quality products built in-house by our American employees, D-Tech is able to make a significant investment in the local area, creating new jobs for Cape May County residents, from service positions to manufacturing opportunities.\" 'D-Tech has expanded 100% since 2016, and therefore to meet the increased demand for our products, we will be employing from the local community.' Committed to Cape May County Beachgoers and birdwatchers alike flock from states near and far to enjoy the golden sandy beaches, warm weather and incredible wildlife Cape May County has to offer. Alongside a tremendous variety of migrating birds, some lucky visitors even manage to glimpse wild dolphins, which are spotted frequently from the shore. However, while the beautiful region is popular with tourists during the summer months, the decision was made that the county should create more economic opportunities outside of tourism. This goal was stated by Will Morey at the groundbreaking in 2019, 'We need to find new ways to diversify and create jobs that attract top talent, which will enable our young folks to find great opportunities within the county.' Today, the first step on that journey is complete as the project has its first residents. D-Tech is joined at the Cape May Tech Village by Cellular Tracking Technologies, a leader in wildlife telemetry and IoT solutions. About D-Tech D-Tech has been delivering high performance technology solutions for public spaces for almost 20 years. Having built its initial success in the library sector, D-Tech has continually seen an increase in cross-sector demand for its range of technologies, which include self-service solutions, privacy-protecting people counting and now even app technology.

    "summary": "The rise of big tech and how it will impact startupsShare this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email ShareIf there was ever a doubt about the abuse of power by big tech companies, their appearance in front of the US Congress has ended such doubts about the abusive nature of these companies. Revelations by the long-running antitrust investigation show that everyone in business who has been dealing with big tech should be concerned. African Tech startups with a potential for global reach should be more concerned. It is almost impossible to operate in the tech space and reach a global market without using either the Apple App Store, Amazon AWS, and other platforms owned by big tech companies. One factor that stood out during the hearings is that there's unequal treatment of companies on the App Store by Apple. One document that was presented during the hearings showed how Amazon Prime was paying fewer fees to Apple for its presence on the App store. This is just one example that shows unfair treatment by the global giant, Apple. If a similar service by an African startup were to exist on the App store it would have a lesser chance of success in terms of revenue earned on the App store. Acquisitions are another area that should concern many African tech startups. Naturally being acquired by a global tech company excites tech founders who dream of scaling their products. Based on recent revelations and what has been known about big tech companies, African tech founders should adopt a different view of acquisitions by big tech companies.The story of how and why Facebook acquired Instagram should serve as a lesson for many who dream of being acquired by big tech companies.It's a known fact that Kevin Systrom, Instagram founder, had a tough time within Facebook after the app was acquired. We now know that the strategy was always about killing the enemy by acquisition. The same happened to WhatsApp. Facebook is currently working on integrating all these acquired products under Facebook while they maintain their identity. It's also important to note that the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram are no longer within Facebook and left the company extremely unhappy. The lesson here is that being acquired by big tech is not always what it looks like. The behaviour of big tech companies is something that should not only concern leading tech startups. Even small guys who are just trying to sell a unique product on Amazon should be concerned. The testimony about Amazon showed how the tech company cannibalizes the very entrepreneurs that sell their products on Amazon by creating similar goods thereby competing or removing them completely. The moral of the story here is that Africa should figure out a way to stand on its own. Reliance on global tech platforms will not lead to global tech entities that are Africa owned.As long as big tech continues on this trajectory every promising startup will be gobbled and stopped on its tracks by global giants.The big tech is currently under scrutiny not just in the US. Recently regulators in Australia have accused Alphabet's Google of misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising, seeking a fine 'in the millions. In Africa, however, big tech has been enjoying a free ride.As African regulators are doing nothing about big tech, African tech startups should find ways of protecting themselves against falls acquisitions and cloning by big tech.*Wesley Diphoko is the Editor-In-Chief of Fast Company (SA) magazine.This article was originally published in Fast Company.",

    "excerpt": "Kansas City moved up two spots this year in CBRE's annual Scoring Tech Talent report, which ranks the top 50 North American tech markets.",
    "summary": "Kansas City moved up two spots this year in CBRE's annual Scoring Tech Talent report, which ranks the top 50 North American tech markets. The metro ranked No. 30 overall and was evaluated on 13 metrics, such as tech graduation rates, tech job concentration, tech labor pool size, and labor and real estate costs. The San Francisco Bay Area took the No. 1 spot, followed by Seattle, Washington, D.C., Toronto and the New York City metro. During the pandemic last year, tech jobs in the U.S. grew 0.8%, compared with non-tech occupations, which declined 5.5%. The hottest tech roles were software developers and programmers, which accounted for 85,000 new jobs last year in the U.S. – a 4.8% increase from 2019. With 52,630 tech employees, the Kansas City market has the 29th largest tech talent labor pool in the U.S. It's also among the most affordable markets for tech companies, ranking No. 11. CBRE used the scenario of a 500-employee company leasing a 75,000-square-foot office to compare costs among the markets. In addition to rent cost, it also took into account tech talent wages, non-tech talent wages and management wages. In Kansas City, the total annual cost is $40.1 million. The cheapest is the Waterloo region, $31.3 million. Examples of other market costs are: Austin, $45.6 million; Denver, $51.4 million; San Francisco Bay Area, $68.6 million; and Chicago, $46.5 million. 'The tech industry has shown its adaptability across the U.S. during Covid-19 and Kansas City has been no exception,' Brian Bacon, CBRE first vice president in Kansas City, said in a release. 'There are several factors to this, including Kansas City's low operating costs for tech companies, low cost of living for tech employees, our strong Midwest work ethic culture and the growing millennial population within the city. As a result, Kansas City has grown into becoming one of the largest large tech talent markets.' In the Kansas City market, tech workers comprise 5.1% of the overall workforce and their average salary is $86,770, a 6% rise since 2015. St. Louis has slightly more tech workers at 55,080, but they comprise 4.2% of the overall workforce. In San Francisco, its 373,430 tech workers comprise 10.9% of the overall workforce. Another key metric is the millennial population, which has bolstered the growth of tech talent in all 50 markets and has contributed to the revitalization of downtown neighborhoods, according to the report. Since 2014, the Kansas City market has seen its millennial population rise by 53,932 people, a 12.5% increase. The growth rate puts Kansas City at No. 16 among the other markets. Like other markets, Kansas City must continue to diversify its tech workforce, according to a recent KC Tech Specs report from the KC Tech Council. The metro's tech industry falls into the third quartile of the diversity index, which looks at the quantity and distribution of race and ethnicity in the workforce. Black employees comprise just 7% of the region's tech workforce, followed by 4% Hispanic. Women account for 26% of the local tech workforce. According to the report, 35% of an employee's emotional investment in their work and 20% of their desire to stay at their company is tied to feelings of inclusion. To help area employers diversify their workforce, the KC Tech Council teamed up with tech apprenticeship program, Apprenti, which puts an emphasis of connecting with communities that are underrepresented in the tech industry.",

Tampa Bay ranked No. 10 among the 50 largest tech talent markets in the nation, with a millennial population increase of 14.5% since 2014, which totals more than 84,525 people. The usual suspects remained supreme: San Francisco was No. 1 on the annual list, with Seattle, Washington, D.C., Toronto and New York City rounding out the top.  The region fell overall to No. 33 on the annual Tech Talent Analyzer report, down from No. 29 in 2020. The report, conducted by CBRE Group (NYSE: CBRE), analyzes 13 metrics of a regions' ability to attract and develop tech talent, ranging from tech graduation rates, tech-job concentration, tech labor pool size, and labor and real estate costs.  Tampa Bay did have some standout marks, though. It was No. 28 overall among the largest tech talent labor pool, with roughly 53,000 tech workers. It also has the ninth fastest-growing tech talent labor pool among the top 50 regions, increasing 23.5% since 2015. The region's overall tech talent labor pool is roughly 53,900 workers.  'Tampa continues to attract tech talent ... adding 2,274 more tech jobs than tech degrees to its workforce ... [which has] contributed greatly to the growth of tech talent in the market,' Michael DiBlasi, managing director of CBRE in Tampa, said in a statement. 'Along with the market's millennial population growth, diverse tech graduates and strong labor pool, we expect Tampa to continue to grow as a tech talent market in the future.'",

    "excerpt": "Tech companies will grow exponentially for the next two decades, far outpacing other investments, strategic advisory firm Aquaa Partners said on Friday.",
    "summary": "regis duvignau/Reuters Value investing is dead and investors will find long-term exponential growth in tech stocks, a report said on Friday. Strategic advisory firm Aquaa Partners suggested that companies ignoring tech will stagnate and lose value, while indexes tracking tech firms will grow exponentially for the next two decades, far outpacing other investments. Read: Will videogames be the Achilles heel for Big Tech in antitrust investigations? The London-based firm forecasts that the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index will reach 90,948 in 2040, around eight times higher than its current level — but while tech is a good bet, investors should bolster their portfolios with alternative investments. 'Fine wine and stamps as well as art and other collectibles as investments tend to be uncorrelated to tech company equities and other asset classes and as such can serve as an effective hedge,' said Paul Cuatrecasas, chief executive of Aquaa Partners. The report suggests that the best long-term hedge is inflation-protected assets like property, fine wine, stamps, gold and cryptocurrencies. Cuatrecasas is a tech-focused investment adviser who believes technology will become more pervasive in society, leaving companies ignoring its rise falling behind. Aquaa Partners' report considers tech companies like holiday rental unicorn Airbnb, chip maker Intel INTC, +0.22% and e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN, -0.38% that use technology to differentiate themselves, deliver products, or create a competitive advantage. It was released on Friday, after tech company Apple AAPL, +5.15% recorded a $2 trillion dollar valuation on Wednesday. This was just two years after it first hit $1 trillion — which had taken 42 years. 'Apple is a great example of exponential value captured in a company's growth,' Cuatrecasas said. Aquaa Partners defy tech doomsters and suggest that the sector is now a safe-haven for growth. The firm said that through the coronavirus-induced market crash, tech stocks saw a maximum loss of 21.2%, while non-tech stocks saw a maximum fall of 36.4%. Read: ‘Fortnite's' impact could be Epic on antitrust investigations of Big Tech 'Since the late 1990s. the tech sector has transitioned from being volatile and risky to becoming a safe haven of value over the long term,' the report said. Cuatrecasas said: 'The fundamental risk-reward relationship in finance is now consistently being broken: Tech now offers higher reward and lower levels of risk relative to traditional stocks.'",

    "summary": "Tech salaries are on the rise across all major tech hubs, including Silicon Valley ($123,826), Seattle ($109,628) and Boston ($108,438), according to data from Dice Technology's 2020 Tech Salary Report. But the real news is that many emerging tech hubs, with notably lower total costs of living, are doing just as well. These smaller cities and metro areas typically offer a blend of tech and non-tech companies seeking to hire IT workers for software development, computer engineering, cloud computing, IT support, customer service and more.The following six emerging tech hubs are delivering significant tech salary gains and are pulling in new tech talent and companies thanks to access to venture capital, local universities and colleges and often a lower cost of living, according to Dice.Columbus, OhioThe state of Ohio is home to headquarters and outposts of 55 Fortune 1000 companies, including Facebook, which built a complex in central Ohio. Columbus, in particular, is a notable tech hub, and is home to IBM's Watson Health (Explorys) and its North American Center for Advanced Analytics. The city also won a U.S. Department of Transportation's Smart City Challenge. Tech job postings in Columbus grew 38 percent over the previous year, and tech workers earn a reported average salary of $92,017 per year, which is up 14 percent from the previous year. Salaries have risen to be almost on par with established tech hub Austin, Texas, where the average tech salary is $95,118 but the cost of living is 12 percent higher.Columbus ranks in the top 10 cities for tech markets, top 10 for rising startup cities and it's in one of four states that provides property tax exemption and incentives for data centers, according to data from JobsOhio. According to Dice, companies such as Accenture, JPMorgan Chase, Huntington National Bank, Careworks and IBM are all looking to hire tech and IT workers in large quantities.St. LouisTech salaries in St. Louis have risen nearly 14 percent over the past year, despite job postings for tech dropping 6 percent. The average tech salary in St. Louis falls just under $98,000, according to data from Dice. Key employers in the area include Boeing, IBM, Wells Fargo, Edward Jones and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, all of which are seeking IT workers in large volumes to fill their ranks. Additionally, Dice notes the federal National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's (NGA) announcement that it plans to build a campus in St. Louis, which will be home to 3,100 employers. St. Louis is poised as a fast growing tech hub, with salaries edging closer to major tech hubs such as San Francisco, where the cost of living is also 56 percent higher, according to data from NerdWallet.Accenture Federal Services announced in June that the company plans to build an advanced technology center in St. Louis that will bring up to 1,400 jobs to the area in the next five years. CEO John Goodman cited the city's 'skilled talent, vibrant technology ecosystem and strong commitment to collaboration between government, civic, business, academic and community partners' as a draw to the area, according to BusinessWire. AtlantaAtlanta is home to the Atlanta Tech Village, which is a small business incubator in the Buckhead community, with 180 tenant companies in its first year. The Atlanta Tech Village is now the fourth largest tech hub in the U.S., with 300 companies as of 2018 and as of 2019, it was responsible for raising nearly $900 million in venture capital financing and had the fourth most tech job postings of any U.S. city. The average salary for tech workers in Atlanta is $94,084 per year, which is up nearly 10 percent from the previous year, according to Dice.While Atlanta has been championing startups for years, it's also attracted the attention of major tech companies. According to Dice, companies such as IBM, Capgemini and Cox Communications are looking to hire tech workers at a 'significant volume.' The report also highlights Home Depot, which is headquartered in Atlanta and is busy hiring IT workers. The city has taken some hits, however, due to COVID-19, with Macy's announcing the company will not be bringing its technology hub to Atlanta's Midtown technology hub, a move that was set to bring 630 jobs to Atlanta. DenverDenver's growing tech hub is known as 'Silicon Mountain,' referring to the city's Rocky Mountain skyline. The average salary for a tech worker in Denver is $102,557 per year, 6.5 percent higher than the previous year, according to Dice. That brings Denver's average tech salary closer to tech hubs such as Seattle, where the average tech salary is $109,628 but the average cost of living is also 41 percent higher.Tech companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Apple all have campuses in the Denver area. In 2019 Amazon announced plans for the expansion of its Denver Tech Hub, adding 400 new high-tech jobs in fields such as cloud computing, software and hardware engineering and advertising, according to BusinessWire. Other key IT employers include Comcast, Bank of America, KPMH and Transamerica, according to Dice. Dice attributes Denver's growth to its available space — major cities such as New York City or San Francisco are congested with tech companies and require higher prices for less square footage, but Denver gives companies enough space to grow.Dallas-Ft. WorthAustin, Texas, has always been considered one of the major tech hubs, where the average tech salary is $95,118 per year, according to data from Dice. But Dallas-Fort Worth is emerging as another major Texas tech hub, where the average tech salary grew nearly 6 percent over the past year with tech employees earning a reported average salary of $95,002 per year. Dice notes that local tech companies such as IBM are on the lookout for software developers, network engineers and project managers and Deloitte is hiring for cybersecurity and solutions architect positions. Tech postings increased 5 percent over the past year with key employers for IT jobs, including Salesforce, Lockheed Martin, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Goldman Sachs.The cost of living in Dallas is 10 percent higher than in Austin and housing costs are 16 percent higher, with the average three-bedroom home selling for over $408,000 in Dallas, compared to just under $350,000 in Austin, according to NerdWallet. Nevertheless, the average cost of living is still lower compared to Seattle, where the cost of living is 44 percent higher than Dallas and the average salary is only around $10,000 higher. The tech industry in Dallas has grown rapidly since between 2006 and 2008 when Texas Instruments and AT&T moved its headquarters to the city. Since then companies such as Oracle, Cisco, Fujitsu Network Communications, HP, Microsoft and Verizon Wireless are just a handful of tech companies that have expanded to Dallas.    San DiegoSilicon Valley has long been the main tech hub of California. But San Diego is becoming an appealing city for tech companies and workers due to its lower cost of living. Tech job listings grew 37 percent in the past year with an average tech salary of $109,428 per year, which grew 5 percent from last year. Amazon expanded to San Diego in 2018, adding 300 tech jobs and companies such as Northrop Grumman, Qualcomm and Booz Allen Hamilton are hiring IT workers at a rapid pace, according to Dice.San Diego is appealing to tech workers in part because its cost of living is 40 percent lower than San Francisco, according to data from NerdWallet. In San Diego, the median home cost is just under $800,000, while it's slightly over $1.25 million in San Francisco. For renters, you can get a two-bedroom apartment for around $2,400 in San Diego, while the same averages around $4,100 in San Francisco. Copyright © 2020 IDG Communications, Inc.",

    "summary": "Representational Image. \n \n \nOver 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\n\n\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\n\n\n \nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\n\n\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. \n\n\nMississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\nThe report, titled ‘Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\n\n\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n \n Published on: \n August 30, 2023 17:26:17 IST",

    "summary": "New Report from The Technology Councils of North America highlights growing national tech workforce thanks to immigration-friendly national policy\n\nKITCHENER, ON, July 11, 2023 /CNW/ -- The Technology Councils of North America (  ) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN) today released \"Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since The Pandemic,\" a new report exploring globalization and migration of tech occupations in Canada. The findings highlight that between April 2022 and March 2023, 32,115 new workers came to Canada with the most migrating from India and Nigeria. This move is due largely in part to a more immigration-friendly national policy and a labor cost advantage. The report also highlighted the most attractive Canadian cities to top tech talent, with Mississauga, Ont., ranking first followed by Montreal, Que. and Waterloo, Ont.\n\nOntario boasts the largest number of tech workers within the country, but smaller provinces, like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, are experiencing the most rapid growth. Both reported the largest year-over-year growth in their respective tech workforces, at 16.3%. Windsor, Ontario has seen the highest growth in tech workers over the past year (28%), followed by Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and Timmins, Ontario. This shift is reflective of broader workforce trends, with largely remote tech workers moving away from major metropolitan areas toward more rural locations.\n\n\"Our goal at  is to serve as the collective voice of the regional tech hubs and tech associations we represent to help build the North American technology economy. This report is an important step in supporting this growth and helping our Canadian members better understand the state of the current workforce ecosystem,\" said Yvonne Pilon, Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, , and President & CEO of Windsor-based WEtech Alliance. \"Given the radical shortfall in tech workers to fill available jobs in recent years, it's imperative we understand migration movements to better serve our members, the innovation workforce, and the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nKey Findings\n\n*Migration findings from April 2022-March 2023\n\nCanada's Top Ranking Net Migration of Tech Workers by Country\n\nIndia (15,097 tech workers)\n\n(15,097 tech workers) Nigeria (1,808 tech workers)\n\n(1,808 tech workers) Brazil (1,675 tech workers)\n\n(1,675 tech workers) Ukraine (1,207 tech workers)\n\n(1,207 tech workers) Philippines (1,129 tech workers)\n\n(1,129 tech workers) Iran (1,046 tech workers)\n\n(1,046 tech workers) France (935 tech workers)\n\n(935 tech workers) UAE (744 tech workers)\n\nHong Kong SAR (715 tech workers)\n\nPakistan (588 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Largest In-Migration by City\n\nMississauga, Ontario (1,900 tech workers)\n\n(1,900 tech workers) Montreal, Quebec (959 tech workers)\n\n(959 tech workers) Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (633 tech workers)\n\n(633 tech workers) Windsor, Ontario, Canada (557 tech workers)\n\n(557 tech workers) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (525 tech workers)\n\n(525 tech workers) Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada (456 tech workers)\n\n, Canada (456 tech workers) Kitchener, Ontario, Canada (437 tech workers)\n\n(437 tech workers) London, Ontario, Canada (418 tech workers)\n\n(418 tech workers) Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (363 tech workers)\n\n(363 tech workers) Calgary, Alberta, Canada (331 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Tech Industry Workforce by Province and Territories, 1-Year Percent Growth\n\nSaskatchewan (16.3%)\n\n(16.3%) Newfoundland and Labrador (16.3%)\n\nand (16.3%) Manitoba (15.4%)\n\n(15.4%) Nova Scotia (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Alberta (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Ontario (13.7%)\n\n(13.7%) New Brunswick (12.9%)\n\n(12.9%) British Columbia (12.3%)\n\n(12.3%) Yukon (12.2%)\n\n(12.2%) Prince Edward Island (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Quebec (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Northwest Territories (9.4%)\n\n(9.4%) Nunavut (6.5%)\n\nOntario's Top 10 Global Regions of Tech Worker Net Migration (Gained Talent - Lost Talent)\n\nKarnataka, India (+797 net change)\n\n(+797 net change) Maharashtra, India (+688 net change)\n\n(+688 net change) Gujarat, India (+417 net change)\n\n(+417 net change) Telangana, India (+392 net change)\n\n(+392 net change) Tamil Nadu, India (+386 net change)\n\n(+386 net change) Ukraine (+353 net change)\n\n(+353 net change) Quebec, Canada (+309 net change)\n\n(+309 net change) Delhi, India (+290 net change)\n\n(+290 net change) Kerala, India (+246 net change)\n\n(+246 net change) Nigeria (+217 net change)\n\nWhile Canada has lost talent to the U.S. overall, net loss is not significant at only 1,672 workers. Considering the population of the U.S. compared to Canada and the total tech workforce of each, this demonstrates Canada's competitiveness to tech employment opportunities. Canada is gaining American talent from the Northeastern states, and still attracting talent from major U.S. cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. The average compensation for U.S. tech occupations per the report is $175,600 CAD ($133,500 USD), while the average compensation for the same tech occupations in Canada is $100,400 CAD ($73,897 USD).\n\n\"We are thrilled with the recent announcement by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, as it paves the way for Canada to welcome workers with H1B visas into our tech ecosystem. This groundbreaking program is set to bring 10,000 highly skilled professionals to our country, fortifying our position as a leading destination for tech talent,\" said Chris Albinson, CEO and president at Communitech. \"In addition, the Toronto-Waterloo corridor, one of North America's largest and fastest growing tech hubs, already attracts talented individuals on a daily basis, and this new initiative will propel our ecosystem to even greater heights. Equally important, the valuable data provided in this study grants Canadian teams crucial insights into tech talent migration, empowering them to make informed hiring decisions, and better serve the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nCanada's tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from BDC and combined with the findings in this data report, signify the country might be giving its southern counterpart a run for its money. The large migration of tech workers also fills the need for skilled workers amid an ongoing global talent shortage and points to a hopeful and prosperous future for Canada's tech occupation workforce.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe report is based on data sourced by labor market data and includes data points from numerous sources collected, analyzed, and visualized by eIMPACT .\n\nFor purposes of this study, \"tech talent / occupations / workers\" is defined by a proxy custom group of NOC linked occupation skill codes including roles such as Software Developers, Network and Computer Systems Administrators, and Information Security Analysts. This group of tech workers is sometimes referred to as a tech occupation cluster and tech occupation profiles.\n\n \n\nThe Technology Councils of North America () represents approximately 60 IT and Technology trade organizations that, in turn, represent more than 22,000 technology-related companies in North America.  serves its members and the industry through its strong peer-to-peer network and its regional initiatives to raise the visibility and viability of the technology industry. This is accomplished by empowering regional technology organizations and serving as their collective voice in growing the North American technology economy. More information on  can be found at: www.tecna.org or @techcouncils on Twitter.\n\n Canada's Tech Network\n\nCanada's Tech Network (formerly known as the Canadian Digital Media Network) is a network of 28 regional innovation hubs across Canada, all focused on supporting Canada's technology entrepreneurs. Designated a federal Centre of Excellence in Commercialization and Research, Canada's Tech Network is dedicated to establishing Canada as a world leader in the digital economy.\n\nMore than a group of business accelerators and incubators, Canada's Tech Network is a community of backbone organizations within regional innovation ecosystems across the country. Each Hub provides physical space, mentorship, advice and expertise to directly support Canadian firms. Network members help tech SMEs to access talent, investment capital and global market opportunities.

    "excerpt": "Metro #Orlando's #tech talent pool is one of the fastest-growing in the nation, but experts say demand still outpaces the supply. #jobs #technology #localbusiness #businessnews @bluewaverp @ucf @cbre",
    "summary": "Metro Orlando's tech talent pool is one of the fastest-growing in the nation, according to data released July 14 by Dallas-based commercial real estate brokerage CBRE. But while the growth is good news — bringing high-wage jobs and crucial talent to the region — it still lags behind what is needed to keep up with sky-high demand for tech workers in Central Florida and beyond. For an example of the tough hiring market local tech companies face, look no further than Winter Springs-based information technologies firm Tech Rage IT LLC. The company this year hired a recruiter for the first time ever after it went months without filling two open roles, Director of Technology Services Matt Rose said. Stories like this are common in the region, even as the tech industry and its workforce expand. \"The demand is outpacing the increase in talent, hands down,\" Charlie Lewis, founder and CEO of Orlando-based tech recruiting firm BlueWave, told Orlando Business Journal. Orlando's tech talent pool grew 30% to 43,340 people between 2016 and 2020, according to CBRE. It was the seventh-fastest-growing market among the 42 U.S. metros in the report.  Still, it is not enough to meet the demand for new workers. There were 6,665 tech job postings in metro Orlando in the second quarter, according to a recent CompTIA analysis of Burning Glass Technologies Labor Insights data. The region added 1,110 new job postings last quarter, the analysis found.  During the past five years, the local tech talent pool on average added 625 workers per quarter, short of the more than 1,000 job openings created in just the past quarter. The growth of the local workforce in the past five years has been the most impressive Lewis has witnessed since he began working in the local tech field in 2007, he said. However, the talent war is increasingly national and global, with tech companies from outside the region hiring from Orlando's talent pool, he said.  Plus, the need for tech workers spans far beyond technology companies as every industry embraces tech-based solutions, Lewis added. \"You can't survive, and you're not going to be competitive in another five years if you can't keep up with the tech.\" This is a nationwide trend accelerated by the pandemic, according to CBRE's report. \"Businesses pivoted, innovated and relied even more on tech talent workers to meet challenges. This kept the tech talent labor market highly competitive and supply-constrained last year as hiring expanded beyond major tech hubs.\" Another issue that makes it tough for companies to recruit is some innovative tech fields, and the skillsets required to work in them, change so fast, said Carol Ann Dykes Logue, director of programs and operations for the University of Central Florida's innovation districts and business incubators. \"How do you keep up the supply of the workforce when things are changing so rapidly?\" Here are some other Orland tech takeaways from the report:  Wage growth: The average local wage among tech workers is $89,180. Wages jumped nearly 14% since 2016. Brain drain: Orlando universities awarded 12,560 tech degrees but added only 10,000 new tech workers in the last five years. This means the region faces an outflow of university tech talent, a phenomenon known as \"brain drain.\" Diversity problem: Orlando is the fourth-least diverse market when it comes to women in the tech field. Women make up 25% of Central Florida's tech workforce, compared to women making up 53% of total office workers. Washington, D.C., ranked as the metro with the strongest representation of women in tech.  The region's tech workforce is important because it provides it provides an employee base for local companies and it generates high wages for Central Florida. The average local tech wage of more than $89,000 is much higher than metro Orlando's average annual wage of $48,530, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    "summary": "February 17, 2021 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Leaders in Canadian tech are rallying online May 12-13, 2021 to learn, share, network and grow at Tech Talent North. The producers behind SAAS NORTH, Canada's largest gathering of SaaS entrepreneurs, are excited to announce the launch of sister event Tech Talent North, presented by HR Tech Group. 'Hyper-growth was in effect for many tech companies in 2020, while some verticals within tech struggled with layoffs and furloughs. Canada's tech industry is rewriting its talent playbook to meet the challenges and impact of the global pandemic, which includes managing highly distributed workforces and radical pivots. Many of the most challenging side effects of the pandemic fall squarely into the human-resources category,' notes Dave Tyldesley, Co-founder of Cube Business Media Inc. and Producer of Tech Talent North. Originally founded in 2002, the Tech Talent Conference carved out a reputation as a thoughtful and highly curated forum for leaders in Human Resources in BC's thriving tech community. Now, Cube Business Media Inc., a preeminent national producer of B2B conferences, and HR Tech Group have joined forces to take the event to new heights with a pivot to an online conference in 2021 and national expansion. This scaled-up and re-branded version of the acclaimed conference is now known as Tech Talent North — drawing tech talent game changers from coast-to-coast. Stephanie Hollingshead, CEO of HR Tech Group adds, 'While many sectors weakened, Canada's tech sector has continued to grow overall during this pandemic. We are seeing some explosive growth within SaaS, VFX, gaming, clean tech, AI and life sciences, and the overall demand for key technical and leadership talent continues to outstrip the supply. Attracting, hiring, retaining, and motivating a diverse technical workforce is critical to these companies' successes.' Helping shape the Tech Talent North program is an array of advisors from firms such as: Shopify, Ceridian, Unbounce, Kabam Games, Certn, Visier, Routific, Hootsuite and more. While attendees won't be meeting physically this year, there will be plenty of opportunities to network with peers to learn from their challenges and successes. Using innovative technology, attendees can connect to have meaningful conversations with conference delegates, speakers and other players in the tech ecosystem. 'During the pandemic, HR issues have emerged as some of the top challenges for Canadian tech companies. The 2021 conference will showcase the most compelling workforce planning, diversity, talent acquisition and culture curation solutions. We will share how the best managed companies have tackled rapid changes to their workforces,' says Laurie Murdoch, 2021 Conference Chair, Vice President, People & Organization, Sony Pictures Imageworks Canada Inc.

Bay Valley Tech alumni have successfully secured technology jobs at leading companies such as E&J Gallo and Tyler Technologies, as well as Turlock Unified School District and the County of Merced. OVCB recently presented a sizable donation to Bay Valley Foundation's scholarship fund which will ensure that at least 10 more deserving students are able to complete the program.'As advocates for education throughout our community, we wholeheartedly endorse the valuable training that Bay Valley Tech provides citizens in the Central Valley. Their fast-growing software developer training program has proven to be effective in helping aspiring tech workers — many from underrepresented groups — transition into higher-paying tech jobs,' explained OVCB President & CEO, Chris Courtney. 'Bay Valley Tech is providing an invaluable low-barrier pathway to ensure workers gain entry into lucrative tech careers, while simultaneously bolstering the local economy by attracting tech employers.'As software continues to transform the global economy, creating unprecedented opportunities for skilled tech workers, Bay Valley Tech's free training program is helping local residents land these high-paying jobs. With 800 code academy applicants last year, many Bay Valley Tech alumni are now working as professional software developers. Tech diversity is strong as well — over 40% of Bay Valley Tech students are Latino and 34% are women.'Oak Valley Community Bank's partnership will be crucial in expanding the Central Valley's tech workforce and stimulating local entrepreneurship,' stated Phillip Lan, President of Bay Valley Tech, whose programs train people to start tech businesses in addition to teaching software development.While other code academies can cost as much as $20,000, Bay Valley Tech's free program provides an excellent option for underserved communities, including working parents and others seeking entry into higher-paying tech careers. Bay Valley Tech partners with employers who advise on curriculum and provide internships for code academy students. Students don't just get a free ride, however, as they are required to volunteer on local non-profit technology initiatives and mentor newer code academy students.Code academy classes combine self-paced lessons and live online evening class meetings which ensure maximum flexibility for students. The next cohort begins later this month with more scheduled this fall. Classes are filling up quickly, so interested students are encouraged to apply on the Bay Valley Tech code academy application webpage as soon as possible: https://www.bayvalleytech.com/code-academy-application About Bay Valley TechBay Valley Tech is an inclusive free free code academy and coding bootcamp , training students in modern programming skills and connecting them with prospective employers.

    "summary": "Image: Credit: Global Tech Talent Visa \n\n\n\n Silicon Valley giants may have rushed to adopt ambitious climate strategies in recent years, but they are not being emulated by their smaller peers in the technology sector. \nThat is the conclusion of a new survey of over 150 UK tech industry leaders, which found 59 per cent of tech businesses are not measuring their environmental impact, with new entrants to the market doing less than their larger, more established competitors to tackle their emissions.\nWhile the pandemic-induced rise in home working and remote socialising has highlighted the carbon-reduction opportunities the tech industry presents, the survey highlights how many tech businesses are yet to embrace even basic environmental best practices.\nThe survey was conducted on behalf of Tech London Advocates, an independent network of 10,000 tech leaders, experts, and investors and suggests that a high percentage of businesses in the sector do not have a dedicated climate policy in place.\nThe UK government has committed to deliver net zero emissions by 2050, yet more than one-third of tech startups and scaleups have no commitment or policy in place to match the target.\n'Lack of data' was the most common factor preventing businesses from doing more to address their environmental impact, respondents said. \nIn response, Tech London Advocates and its international parent organisation, Global Tech Advocates, said it would now harness its network of 20,000 tech leaders in 20 of the world's fastest-growing tech cities and regions to develop a series of Climate Commitments.\nThe commitments will be focused on driving climate action among startups and small businesses which account for the majority of the tech sector, the organisers said. They include using technology to measure a business's environmental impact, making carbon impact a board level discussion, and a pledge to \"see waste everywhere, track it and start to reduce it\".\n\"Government, corporates and tech giants have made big commitments to address climate change and become net zero,\" said Russ Shaw CBE, founder of Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates. \"Now, we need to see action from the silent majority of tech startups and scaleups. Technology can address many of the challenges relating to climate change, but first the industry needs to take action.\"\nThe research coincided with Investor Showcase 3.0: The Tech for Net Zero Edition, hosted by Global Tech Advocates and Tech London Advocates last month. The event brought together leading tech investors from across Europe to discuss the growth opportunity in green tech, clean tech, sustainability and circular economy across Europe.",

    "excerpt": "Atlanta's growing tech talent pool, diversity and affordability may make it 'one of the largest tech markets in the globe in the next five to 10 years,\" CBRE's Christian Devlin said.",
    "summary": "The number of graduates earning technology-related degrees in Atlanta is growing faster than anywhere else in the U.S, a new report shows.  'We're in a transformation,' said Christian Devlin, senior vice president at commercial real estate firm CBRE, who is based in Atlanta. 'We're going from a high-growth tech market to a mature tech market.'  Atlanta is ranked No. 8 in tech talent overall, according to CBRE's Scoring Tech Talent report. CBRE uses 13 metrics related to job creation and innovation to score each market's talent. Talent concentration is the biggest factor in the scores. The city has jumped two rankings since 2015.  Major markets such as San Francisco, New York and Toronto dominate the tech talent growth because of their size, the report says. Seattle, Washington, D.C., Boston and Austin also rank above Atlanta.   The report shows key strengths in Atlanta's talent pool — steady growth, leading diversity and affordability. Those strengths will propel Atlanta through its period of transformation and may make it 'one of the largest tech markets in the globe in the next five to 10 years,' Devlin said.  Talent growth  Between 2015-2019, Atlanta tech degree completions increased by 90.5%, the highest growth rate out of the top 50 tech hubs.  That growth pushes Atlanta to No. 7 in number of tech degrees completed in 2019 at about 8,300. New York has the highest at 20,500.  Devlin credits Georgia Tech with much of this growth. More than 4,000 undergraduate and graduate engineers graduated from Georgia Tech's College of Engineering in 2020, according to the college.  'Georgia Tech is the highest tech talent degree-producing university in North America,' Devlin said.  The number of tech occupations and millennials in the city is increasing alongside the growth of tech graduates, according to the report.   Between 2015-2020, tech occupations increased 15.2% to 143,780. The average wage for those occupations is $99,700. In the same period, the millennial population increased by 11.6%.   CBRE considers millennials to be the generation driving the tech workforce because they grew up in a tech-enabled work environment. Millennial population increases have fueled the growth of tech markets across the country, according to the report.   Atlanta's growth in tech occupations and millennials does not stand out among other markets but rather reflects a nationwide trend. Across the country, tech workers increased by 13% in the past five years, and Atlanta ranks in the middle of the pack for millennial population growth.   Diversity  Atlanta has the most diversity of the top 10 tech markets, according to the report. Overall, it's ranked No. 4 in diversity, trailing Pittsburg, Charlotte and Nashville. Atlanta's tech industry workforce is about 54% white, 19% Asian, 19% Black and 6% Hispanic, according to the report.  San Francisco and Austin, which both rank higher than Atlanta for overall tech talent, have some of the lowest diversity rankings out of all the markets.   Atlanta is at the forefront of the conversation as the tech industry confronts its diversity problem.   Companies need to relocate to areas with diverse talent if they want to have more inclusive workforces, according to the Harvard Business Review. Atlanta has enjoyed the benefits of this trend over the past couple of years.   Microsoft and Airbnb said diverse talent was a major factor in their decisions to open massive, local offices. Other companies often cite the city's diversity as an advantage or an attraction.  Affordability  Atlanta remains an affordable market based on office and apartment rent, according to the report.   Office rent per square foot in Atlanta is $29.54, compared to New York and San Francisco, which are $77.25 and $70.04, respectively.   Atlanta's average monthly apartment rent is $1,302. New York and San Francisco are once again the most expensive at $2,589 and $2,504, respectively.   But rent prices have increased by 20% over the past five years in Atlanta, according to the report. That trend is permeating through the metro Atlanta real estate market, which is overall considered affordable but is seeing rapid change.  Devlin doesn't see the increases as a threat to Atlanta's tech hub status.   'It's increasing, but it's increasing from a very low base,' Devlin said. 'We're still a cost-compelling market to live and do business, especially given supply and quality of talent.'",

Bay Valley Tech alumni have successfully secured technology jobs at leading companies such as E&J Gallo and Tyler Technologies, as well as Turlock Unified School District and the County of Merced. OVCB recently presented a sizable donation to Bay Valley Foundation's scholarship fund which will ensure that at least 10 more deserving students are able to complete the program.'As advocates for education throughout our community, we wholeheartedly endorse the valuable training that Bay Valley Tech provides citizens in the Central Valley. Their fast-growing software developer training program has proven to be effective in helping aspiring tech workers — many from underrepresented groups — transition into higher-paying tech jobs,' explained OVCB President & CEO, Chris Courtney. 'Bay Valley Tech is providing an invaluable low-barrier pathway to ensure workers gain entry into lucrative tech careers, while simultaneously bolstering the local economy by attracting tech employers.'As software continues to transform the global economy, creating unprecedented opportunities for skilled tech workers, Bay Valley Tech's free training program is helping local residents land these high-paying jobs. With 800 code academy applicants last year, many Bay Valley Tech alumni are now working as professional software developers. Tech diversity is strong as well — over 40% of Bay Valley Tech students are Latino and 34% are women.'Oak Valley Community Bank's partnership will be crucial in expanding the Central Valley's tech workforce and stimulating local entrepreneurship,' stated Phillip Lan, President of Bay Valley Tech, whose programs train people to start tech businesses in addition to teaching software development.While other code academies can cost as much as $20,000, Bay Valley Tech's free program provides an excellent option for underserved communities, including working parents and others seeking entry into higher-paying tech careers. Bay Valley Tech partners with employers who advise on curriculum and provide internships for code academy students. Students don't just get a free ride, however, as they are required to volunteer on local non-profit technology initiatives and mentor newer code academy students.Code academy classes combine self-paced lessons and live online evening class meetings which ensure maximum flexibility for students. The next cohort begins later this month with more scheduled this fall. Classes are filling up quickly, so interested students are encouraged to apply on the Bay Valley Tech code academy application webpage as soon as possible: https://www.bayvalleytech.com/code-academy-application About Bay Valley TechBay Valley Tech is an inclusive free free code academy and coding bootcamp , training students in modern programming skills and connecting them with prospective employers.

    "excerpt": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:",
    "summary": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:Two days prior to Southern California and UCLA's move to the Big Ten commandeered the headlines, the league unveiled its new football scheduling model, relegating the Atlantic and Coastal divisions to the mothballs. The format is ideal for a 14-team conference, tripling the frequency of matchups such as Virginia Tech-Clemson and Virginia-Wake Forest.Starting in 2023, you'll play three rivals annually and the remaining 10 twice every four years. Contrast that to the current divisional structure, in which you face seven opponents annually and the remaining six twice every 12 seasons.But as expected, the assigning of each team's three annual rivals was imperfect. The labyrinth to balancing fairness, tradition and television appeal was always going to end in roadblocks.That reality aside, please excuse those of us lamenting the demise of annual Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake Forest clashes. The Hokies and Hurricanes have met in each of the last 30 seasons, the second-longest continuous series for both programs. Tech has played Virginia every year since 1970, while Miami has encountered Florida State each season since 1969.Moreover, Tech-Miami often matters.The 0-2 Hokies' 1995 upset of the Hurricanes in Week 3 ignited their run to the Big East title and Sugar Bowl. Frank Beamer has often called that victory the most important of his Hall of Fame coaching career.Six seasons later, No. 1 Miami survived a late 2-point conversion attempt by Tech to win the regular-season finale at Lane Stadium 26-24. 'Twas the only game decided by a single-digit margin for the eventual undefeated national champs.The Hokies authored the only top-five conquest in their history with a 2003 rout of the No. 2 Hurricanes and a year later clinched their first ACC title in the 2004 regular-season finale at Miami.And how's this for competitive? The Hokies went 6-6 versus the Hurricanes as Big East members and are 9-9 against them in the ACC, 6-6 all-time when both are ranked.Yet rather than protecting Tech-Miami's annual status, the new model, approved by a majority of conference athletic directors, designates Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wake Forest as the Hokies' yearly rivals. The Hurricanes' are Florida State, Boston College and Louisville.But for all of its history, Tech-Miami is an infant compared to N.C. State-Wake Forest.Dating to 1910, the Wolfpack and Deacons have met in each of the last 112 seasons. Four of the series' last five contests have been one-score affairs, with N.C. State prevailing 45-42 in 2020, Wake by the identical score last year.For what it's worth, the pairings I suggested in May while covering the ACC spring meetings preserved Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake. They also matched Virginia with Wake Forest, an annual opponent that I imagine most Cavaliers faithful would prefer instead of Louisville — UVA's assigned rivals are Virginia Tech, North Carolina and Louisville.As investment advisors always warn, past results do not guarantee future performance, but compiling each ACC program's aggregate conference record since 2014, when membership took its current form, at least offers an idea of how challenging each team's three annual opponents will be.Given Clemson's dominance during that span, it's no surprise that the Tigers' three yearly rivals — Georgia Tech, Florida State and N.C. State — have, on paper, the toughest draws. The remaining pairings appear quite balanced, though Wake Forest, UNC and Pitt might have caught some breaks.What follows is each program's ACC regular-season record since 2014. The number of games vary because of pandemic cancellations in 2020.Now here are the aggregate ACC records since 2014 for each team's three annual opponents.GEORGIA TECH: 117-77 (Clemson, Louisville and Wake Forest)FLORIDA STATE: 116-80 (Clemson, Miami and Syracuse)N.C. STATE: 111-86 (Clemson, Duke and North Carolina)VIRGINIA: 102-96 (Louisville, North Carolina and Virginia Tech)SYRACUSE: 100-96 (Boston College, Florida State and Pitt)BOSTON COLLEGE: 98-99 (Miami, Pitt and Syracuse)CLEMSON: 96-99 (Florida State, Georgia Tech and N.C.

    "title": "Council Post: Prioritize Skilled Women Of Color To Win The Competition For Tech Talent",
    "author": "Bertina Ceccarelli, Forbes Councils Member",

    "clean_url": "forbes.com",
    "excerpt": "The tech-talent shortfall is expected to only worsen as the tech sector grows.",
    "summary": "Bertina Ceccarelli is CEO of NPower, a national nonprofit, rooted in community, and on a mission to advance equity in the tech industry. getty There is no question that the increasingly tech-driven U.S. economy suffers a serious shortage of tech talent that threatens American competitiveness in the digital age. A survey of CNBC's Technology Executive Council last fall found that 57% of the chief information, technology or operations officers said their top worry was finding enough tech-skilled employees, far surpassing concern over supply chain holdups (26%) or cybersecurity attacks (20%) in what kept them awake at night. The tech-talent shortfall is expected to only worsen as the tech sector grows. Some 197,000 IT jobs were added last year than in 2020. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates a demand for 667,000 more tech jobs by 2030. The Great Resignation hitting the entire labor market is making it even harder for the tech sector to keep up with talent needs. Research from my organization's Command Shift Coalition along with Emsi Burning Glass, however, reveals a chronically overlooked existing talent pipeline of 250,000 women of color across U.S. metropolitan areas—talent who in their current non-tech jobs are \"tech-eligible\" for pure tech jobs. Also, close to 500 non-tech jobs in 10 markets that demand tech skills could feasibly be mapped over and transitioned into pure tech jobs. That is, the new talent pipeline of 250,000 women of color possesses foundational, transferable tech skills in their current jobs, such as customer service representatives using CRM software and digital productivity tools or electronic records specialists at doctor's offices. Many non-tech wage workers may be even readier for today's tech jobs because retail, customer service, administrative and other public-engaging work often demands significant people skills and emotional intelligence for problem-solving, task-juggling, project management and prioritization—bringing a level of resourcefulness that's hard to teach. That human touch is often the \"missing middle\" between businesses and their IT operations. \"As companies rapidly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies … [m]ost emerging roles will be fulfilled by people and machines working together,\" an Accenture-Aspen Institute Business and Society Program report says. With a measure of last-mile upskilling training to meet the tech job requirements and set them up for success, this hidden tech talent could be ready for better paying, more secure and upwardly mobile tech jobs—and escape the trap of low-wage \"sandpit\" jobs, as a Brookings Institution study called them. Tapping this rich vein of tech talent isn't as easy as rebooting a computer, however. It requires new thinking and strategies to meet workforce needs. How can businesses help? What are the investment opportunities? To name a few, businesses can: • Challenge the entrenched biases and institutional barriers that have blocked many women of color and other underrepresented people from accessing career jobs, such as tech, and businesses from finding and hiring them. For instance, businesses can undertake targeted outreach and advertising to underrepresented people to welcome them to the tech sector as many feel shut out because so few get to work there. • Revamp traditional HR practices that default to recruiting from within industry sectors or on college campuses, emphasizing pedigree over competency or search based on position descriptions and job titles rather than the skills those positions need. • Help hidden tech-eligible workers recognize their foundational tech skills that could be bolstered and transferred into tech jobs, create résumés that highlight their tech skills for HR managers and recruiters to find and mine and be aware of tech sector opportunities. • Most importantly, as they seek out tech-eligible talent, businesses can invest in upskilling training, onboarding and job support to bridge gaps in tech expertise and professional experience. But companies don't necessarily need to build that training themselves in-house. Rather, they can take advantage of the robust movement of organizations, including private-nonprofit partnerships, that offer upskill training for underrepresented sources of tech talent. NPower's coalition with leading corporations and nonprofit organizations, for example, has committed to help double the number of women of color in tech from less than 5% today to 10% in 10 years. The return on investment goes beyond building a tech talent pool and pipeline. Companies can better achieve their ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion commitments and do their part to help the tech sector look more like America. Overall, investing in hidden tech talent can help strengthen America's workforce—and our economy and competitive edge—by giving everyone a fair chance to reach their full potential and aspirations.

    "excerpt": "Chinese regulators have started to tighten the leash on high-flying Chinese tech stalwarts such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), Baidu, Inc.",
    "summary": "Chinese regulators have started to tighten the leash on high-flying Chinese tech stalwarts such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD). An analyst at Wedbush sees this as presenting an opportunity for their U.S. peers, especially the FAANG stocks. Hopes For Chinese Big Tech Names Evaporating: At the start of the year, Chinese tech giants were positioned to gain more investor mind share due to the complex global backdrop, analyst Daniel Ives said. With the recent DiDi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) IPO fiasco and massive regulatory scrutiny by the communist regime in Beijing, a shadow has ben cast over the Chinese tech stocks in 2021, the analyst said. The underperformance of Chinese tech stocks has to do with the possibility of more regulation in China around the corner, he said. The U.S.-China cold tech war remains a lingering overhang on Chinese tech stocks, Ives said. So far, it looks like the Biden administration is taking a much firmer stance on Beijing, tech companies/IP and the chip industry standoff than the Street was anticipating heading into this January, the analyst said. The recent cyberattacks that appear to be out of China have exacerbated the growing tensions, he said.  Related Link: Alibaba's Ant Group Buckles Under Regulatory Pressure, Agrees To Organize As Financial Holding Company The Setup For US Tech Names: These dynamics bode well for U.S. tech stocks, Ives said. Rotation away from Chinese tech stocks and into U.S. tech creates a \"nirvana setup\" for FAANG names and the tech sector as a whole over the next six to nine months, the analyst said.  FAANGs is the moniker given to big U.S. tech giants Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). \"Our bullish view is US tech stocks will be up another 10%+ into the rest of this year with our NASDAQ 16K year-end target unchanged,\" he said.  The tech bull cycle will continue its upward move in the second-half of 2021 and 2022, given the scarcity of growth names, Ives said.  Heading into second-half and with the imminent June quarter earnings season, Wedbush said it prefers owning secular winners in FAANG, cloud, cybersecurity and 5G.

    "summary": "Wages for tech workers in Richmond are some of the lowest in the country when compared to other tech hub cities.\n\nWhy it matters: The proliferation of remote work during the pandemic created a unique opportunity for cities across the country to establish themselves as hubs for workers and jobs in the tech industry, one of the fastest growing job sectors.\n\nDriving the news: Richmond is solidly a fourth-tier city for tech compensation, according to private company data compiled by Carta, the maker of an equity management software.\n\nAnd Richmond tech workers are paid 75% of what their counterparts in San Francisco make.\n\nYes, but: Being fourth-tier and among the lowest paying probably isn't welcome news for workers, but it's exactly what tech employers are looking for in a workforce. And Richmond's cost of living is objectively considerably lower than San Francisco's.\n\nPlus, the average salary for tech workers in Richmond is $98,673, compared to $53,593 for non tech workers, according to the 2021 Scoring Tech Talent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE.\n\nOf note: Richmond suffers from a 'brain drain' of tech talent, according to the CBRE report. The city produced 3,500 new tech degree graduates between 2015-2019, but it only added 1,800 new tech jobs.",

    "excerpt": "London Tech Week – the showcase of all things innovative – is back. Each day this week, Tech London Advocates",
    "summary": "Europe's largest tech festival, London Tech Week, is back.  The launch event – the Global Leaders Innovation Summit – took place this morning in Southwark. Unicorns, global tech brands and a new Secretary of State dominated proceedings as London's tech community took its first tentative steps back to normality.  The launch mapped out the key themes set to define the next five days – tech's role in the economic recovery, the impact of tech on the planet, future disruption of traditional industries and the economic potential of emerging technologies such as quantum.  The growing prestige of London Tech Week was demonstrated by the calibre of industry leaders at the launch. This year, the festival's grassroots networking events and meet ups were supplemented by two Secretaries of State, senior figures from IBM, Dell Technologies and Experian and the founder of Klarna, one of Europe's most successful tech scaleups.  Speaking of Secretaries of State, the late change from Oliver Dowden to Nadine Dorries as the opening keynote speaker ensured the opening event of London Tech Week was watched with baited breath by policymakers and tech founders alike.  This was the eighth Secretary of State London Tech Week has welcomed since the festival launched in 2014 – and Nadine's first interaction with London's tech community.  While this is clearly not the new Secretary of State's area of professional expertise, what was clear was an appetite to learn, to champion UK tech on the world stage and to break down barriers facing the success of British tech companies.  Read more: Chancellor hails London tech success as capital beats European competitors again In her opening remarks, the Secretary of State doubled down on the metrics that demonstrate the extraordinary success of the industry she has inherited: £13.5bn raised in the first six months of the year and 105 unicorns across the UK.  However, there are major challenges that the Secretary will need to address – challenges around GDPR, diversity and inclusion and access to funding. Tech companies are ready to work closely with their new Cabinet Office representative, but will be watching closely to see whether she is willing to go into battle for the UK's fastest growing industry.  If the eyes of Whitehall were on London Tech Week this morning, then it was the turn of the global tech community in the afternoon. Global Tech Advocates hosted the Tech for Net Zero Showcase, inviting tech leaders from five continents to share updates on the tech innovations designed to tackle climate change taking shape in their local ecosystems.  We heard about technology to grow algae that extracts CO2 from the atmosphere in Mexico, the rise of female founded tech for net zero businesses in the Nordics and the renewed interest of Indian tech investors in British tech for net zero startups.  Beyond the incredible efforts of a global tech community coming together to help the fight back against climate change, it was encouraging to see tech leaders from around the world wanting to speak directly to London's tech sector and play a role in London Tech Week.  So, London Tech Week is back, with new faces and a more international feel than ever before. For a city that has felt like a ghost town over the last 18 months, perhaps the most significant message from the first day of London Tech Week 2021 is that the city's tech companies are back in person and ready to showcase the very best of London tech to investors and tech leaders across the country and around the world.    Read more: UK tech: Record raise of £13.5bn pushes number of British unicorns to 105",

The Gala Dinner announcing all the winners was attended by a record crowd of 1300 including the Prime Minister and the Mayor of Auckland.\nIn selecting Fisher & Paykel Healthcare as the PwC Hi-Tech Company of the Year the international judges said, 'Fisher & Paykel Healthcare are a global leader in respiratory care. When Covid hit, their 5000 employees rose to the occasion and rapidly re-engineered their business to deliver vital products the world desperately needed – addressing, for example, the global shortage of ventilators. All while continuing to innovate and expand their healthcare product offerings, and expand its global reach'.\nOther big winners tonight were Halter and Moxion both taking out two Awards each. Halter won the Endace Most Innovative Hi-Tech Hardware Product and the NZTE Most Innovative Hi-Tech Agritech Solution categories. Meanwhile Moxion picked up the Auckland Unlimited Most Innovative Hi-Tech Creative Technology Solution and Punakaiki Fund Hi-Tech Start-up Company of the Year Awards.\nThe Hi-Tech Awards judges said the calibre of this year's entrants was at an all-time high, making the job of selecting winners exceedingly challenging for the more than 70 local and international judges. The judges assessed a record number of entries across 14 award categories. Commenting on the 2021 Awards, New Zealand Hi-Tech Trust chair David Downs said it was great to hit so many highs this year despite the impact of Covid-19 in 2020. 'Clearly the Covid-19 situation has thrown us a few curve balls in regards to the Awards programme over the last year and it's fantastic that we can all get out this evening and celebrate the successes of our great tech companies, and the contribution they are making not only to New Zealand's economy but also how they are leading us out of the pandemic with such innovative solutions.'\nIn addition to announcing the category winners tonight, Wayne Norrie was recognised with the prestigious Tait Communications Flying Kiwi Award and inducted into the NZ Hi-Tech Hall of Fame. 'Wayne is such a deserving recipient of this recognition. He has contributed so much to the New Zealand tech sector over the years and indeed the success of the Hi-Tech Awards. He is without doubt one of the great ambassadors and advocates for our industry' said Downs.\nThe 2021 NZ Hi-Tech Award winners are:\nXero Hi-Tech Young Achiever\nWinner: Maria English\nVisa Best Hi-Tech Solution for the Public Good\nWinner: Student Volunteer Army & Custom D\nIBM Most Inspiring Individual\nWinner: Craig Hudson\nAuckland Unlimited Most Innovative Hi-Tech Creative Technology Solution\nWinner: Moxion\nHighly Commended: Alimetry\nCallaghan Innovation Hi-Tech Maori Company of the Year\nWinner: MB Century\nDuncan Cotterill Most Innovative Hi-Tech Software Solution\nWinner: Rocos\nEndace Most Innovative Hi-Tech Hardware Product\nWinner: Halter\nKiwibank Most Innovative Hi-Tech Service\nWinner: Chnnl\nNZTE Most Innovative Hi-Tech Agritech Solution\nWinner: Halter\nHalo Consulting Best Contribution to the NZ Tech Sector\nWinner: NZTech\nPunakaiki Fund Hi-Tech Start-up Company of the Year\nWinner: Moxion\nPacific Edge Hi-Tech Emerging Company of the Year\nWinner: Whip Around\nHighly Commended: Lawvu\nSoul Machines Most Innovative Deep Tech Solution\nWinner: Nanolayr (previously known as Revolution Fibres)\nPwC NZ Hi-Tech Company of the Year Award\nWinner: Fisher & Paykel Healthcare\nTait Communications Flying Kiwi Award\nRecipient: Wayne Norrie\nAbout The NZ Hi-Tech Awards\nThe New Zealand Hi-Tech Awards celebrate the success of our producers of goods and services from the software, electronics, telecommunications, mobile, agritech, creative and other high-tech industries.

    "summary": "New Report from The Technology Councils of North America highlights growing national tech workforce thanks to immigration-friendly national policy\n\nKITCHENER, ON, July 11, 2023 /CNW/ -- The Technology Councils of North America (  ) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN) today released \"Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since The Pandemic,\" a new report exploring globalization and migration of tech occupations in Canada. The findings highlight that between April 2022 and March 2023, 32,115 new workers came to Canada with the most migrating from India and Nigeria. This move is due largely in part to a more immigration-friendly national policy and a labor cost advantage. The report also highlighted the most attractive Canadian cities to top tech talent, with Mississauga, Ont., ranking first followed by Montreal, Que. and Waterloo, Ont.\n\nOntario boasts the largest number of tech workers within the country, but smaller provinces, like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, are experiencing the most rapid growth. Both reported the largest year-over-year growth in their respective tech workforces, at 16.3%. Windsor, Ontario has seen the highest growth in tech workers over the past year (28%), followed by Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and Timmins, Ontario. This shift is reflective of broader workforce trends, with largely remote tech workers moving away from major metropolitan areas toward more rural locations.\n\n\"Our goal at  is to serve as the collective voice of the regional tech hubs and tech associations we represent to help build the North American technology economy. This report is an important step in supporting this growth and helping our Canadian members better understand the state of the current workforce ecosystem,\" said Yvonne Pilon, Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, , and President & CEO of Windsor-based WEtech Alliance. \"Given the radical shortfall in tech workers to fill available jobs in recent years, it's imperative we understand migration movements to better serve our members, the innovation workforce, and the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nKey Findings\n\n*Migration findings from April 2022-March 2023\n\nCanada's Top Ranking Net Migration of Tech Workers by Country\n\nIndia (15,097 tech workers)\n\n(15,097 tech workers) Nigeria (1,808 tech workers)\n\n(1,808 tech workers) Brazil (1,675 tech workers)\n\n(1,675 tech workers) Ukraine (1,207 tech workers)\n\n(1,207 tech workers) Philippines (1,129 tech workers)\n\n(1,129 tech workers) Iran (1,046 tech workers)\n\n(1,046 tech workers) France (935 tech workers)\n\n(935 tech workers) UAE (744 tech workers)\n\nHong Kong SAR (715 tech workers)\n\nPakistan (588 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Largest In-Migration by City\n\nMississauga, Ontario (1,900 tech workers)\n\n(1,900 tech workers) Montreal, Quebec (959 tech workers)\n\n(959 tech workers) Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (633 tech workers)\n\n(633 tech workers) Windsor, Ontario, Canada (557 tech workers)\n\n(557 tech workers) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (525 tech workers)\n\n(525 tech workers) Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada (456 tech workers)\n\n, Canada (456 tech workers) Kitchener, Ontario, Canada (437 tech workers)\n\n(437 tech workers) London, Ontario, Canada (418 tech workers)\n\n(418 tech workers) Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (363 tech workers)\n\n(363 tech workers) Calgary, Alberta, Canada (331 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Tech Industry Workforce by Province and Territories, 1-Year Percent Growth\n\nSaskatchewan (16.3%)\n\n(16.3%) Newfoundland and Labrador (16.3%)\n\nand (16.3%) Manitoba (15.4%)\n\n(15.4%) Nova Scotia (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Alberta (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Ontario (13.7%)\n\n(13.7%) New Brunswick (12.9%)\n\n(12.9%) British Columbia (12.3%)\n\n(12.3%) Yukon (12.2%)\n\n(12.2%) Prince Edward Island (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Quebec (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Northwest Territories (9.4%)\n\n(9.4%) Nunavut (6.5%)\n\nOntario's Top 10 Global Regions of Tech Worker Net Migration (Gained Talent - Lost Talent)\n\nKarnataka, India (+797 net change)\n\n(+797 net change) Maharashtra, India (+688 net change)\n\n(+688 net change) Gujarat, India (+417 net change)\n\n(+417 net change) Telangana, India (+392 net change)\n\n(+392 net change) Tamil Nadu, India (+386 net change)\n\n(+386 net change) Ukraine (+353 net change)\n\n(+353 net change) Quebec, Canada (+309 net change)\n\n(+309 net change) Delhi, India (+290 net change)\n\n(+290 net change) Kerala, India (+246 net change)\n\n(+246 net change) Nigeria (+217 net change)\n\nWhile Canada has lost talent to the U.S. overall, net loss is not significant at only 1,672 workers. Considering the population of the U.S. compared to Canada and the total tech workforce of each, this demonstrates Canada's competitiveness to tech employment opportunities. Canada is gaining American talent from the Northeastern states, and still attracting talent from major U.S. cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. The average compensation for U.S. tech occupations per the report is $175,600 CAD ($133,500 USD), while the average compensation for the same tech occupations in Canada is $100,400 CAD ($73,897 USD).\n\n\"We are thrilled with the recent announcement by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, as it paves the way for Canada to welcome workers with H1B visas into our tech ecosystem. This groundbreaking program is set to bring 10,000 highly skilled professionals to our country, fortifying our position as a leading destination for tech talent,\" said Chris Albinson, CEO and president at Communitech. \"In addition, the Toronto-Waterloo corridor, one of North America's largest and fastest growing tech hubs, already attracts talented individuals on a daily basis, and this new initiative will propel our ecosystem to even greater heights. Equally important, the valuable data provided in this study grants Canadian teams crucial insights into tech talent migration, empowering them to make informed hiring decisions, and better serve the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nCanada's tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from BDC and combined with the findings in this data report, signify the country might be giving its southern counterpart a run for its money. The large migration of tech workers also fills the need for skilled workers amid an ongoing global talent shortage and points to a hopeful and prosperous future for Canada's tech occupation workforce.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe report is based on data sourced by labor market data and includes data points from numerous sources collected, analyzed, and visualized by eIMPACT .\n\nFor purposes of this study, \"tech talent / occupations / workers\" is defined by a proxy custom group of NOC linked occupation skill codes including roles such as Software Developers, Network and Computer Systems Administrators, and Information Security Analysts. This group of tech workers is sometimes referred to as a tech occupation cluster and tech occupation profiles.\n\n \n\nThe Technology Councils of North America () represents approximately 60 IT and Technology trade organizations that, in turn, represent more than 22,000 technology-related companies in North America.  serves its members and the industry through its strong peer-to-peer network and its regional initiatives to raise the visibility and viability of the technology industry. This is accomplished by empowering regional technology organizations and serving as their collective voice in growing the North American technology economy. More information on  can be found at: www.tecna.org or @techcouncils on Twitter.\n\n Canada's Tech Network\n\nCanada's Tech Network (formerly known as the Canadian Digital Media Network) is a network of 28 regional innovation hubs across Canada, all focused on supporting Canada's technology entrepreneurs. Designated a federal Centre of Excellence in Commercialization and Research, Canada's Tech Network is dedicated to establishing Canada as a world leader in the digital economy.\n\nMore than a group of business accelerators and incubators, Canada's Tech Network is a community of backbone organizations within regional innovation ecosystems across the country.

    "excerpt": "Chinese regulators have started to tighten the leash on high-flying Chinese tech stalwarts such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), Baidu, Inc.",
    "summary": "Chinese regulators have started to tighten the leash on high-flying Chinese tech stalwarts such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD). An analyst at Wedbush sees this as presenting an opportunity for their U.S. peers, especially the FAANG stocks. Hopes For Chinese Big Tech Names Evaporating: At the start of the year, Chinese tech giants were positioned to gain more investor mind share due to the complex global backdrop, analyst Daniel Ives said. With the recent DiDi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) IPO fiasco and massive regulatory scrutiny by the communist regime in Beijing, a shadow has ben cast over the Chinese tech stocks in 2021, the analyst said. The underperformance of Chinese tech stocks has to do with the possibility of more regulation in China around the corner, he said. The U.S.-China cold tech war remains a lingering overhang on Chinese tech stocks, Ives said. So far, it looks like the Biden administration is taking a much firmer stance on Beijing, tech companies/IP and the chip industry standoff than the Street was anticipating heading into this January, the analyst said. The recent cyberattacks that appear to be out of China have exacerbated the growing tensions, he said.  Related Link: Alibaba's Ant Group Buckles Under Regulatory Pressure, Agrees To Organize As Financial Holding Company The Setup For US Tech Names: These dynamics bode well for U.S. tech stocks, Ives said. Rotation away from Chinese tech stocks and into U.S. tech creates a \"nirvana setup\" for FAANG names and the tech sector as a whole over the next six to nine months, the analyst said.  FAANGs is the moniker given to big U.S. tech giants Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). \"Our bullish view is US tech stocks will be up another 10%+ into the rest of this year with our NASDAQ 16K year-end target unchanged,\" he said.  The tech bull cycle will continue its upward move in the second-half of 2021 and 2022, given the scarcity of growth names, Ives said.  Heading into second-half and with the imminent June quarter earnings season, Wedbush said it prefers owning secular winners in FAANG, cloud, cybersecurity and 5G.

Bay Valley Tech alumni have successfully secured technology jobs at leading companies such as E&J Gallo and Tyler Technologies, as well as Turlock Unified School District and the County of Merced. OVCB recently presented a sizable donation to Bay Valley Foundation's scholarship fund which will ensure that at least 10 more deserving students are able to complete the program.'As advocates for education throughout our community, we wholeheartedly endorse the valuable training that Bay Valley Tech provides citizens in the Central Valley. Their fast-growing software developer training program has proven to be effective in helping aspiring tech workers — many from underrepresented groups — transition into higher-paying tech jobs,' explained OVCB President & CEO, Chris Courtney. 'Bay Valley Tech is providing an invaluable low-barrier pathway to ensure workers gain entry into lucrative tech careers, while simultaneously bolstering the local economy by attracting tech employers.'As software continues to transform the global economy, creating unprecedented opportunities for skilled tech workers, Bay Valley Tech's free training program is helping local residents land these high-paying jobs. With 800 code academy applicants last year, many Bay Valley Tech alumni are now working as professional software developers. Tech diversity is strong as well — over 40% of Bay Valley Tech students are Latino and 34% are women.'Oak Valley Community Bank's partnership will be crucial in expanding the Central Valley's tech workforce and stimulating local entrepreneurship,' stated Phillip Lan, President of Bay Valley Tech, whose programs train people to start tech businesses in addition to teaching software development.While other code academies can cost as much as $20,000, Bay Valley Tech's free program provides an excellent option for underserved communities, including working parents and others seeking entry into higher-paying tech careers. Bay Valley Tech partners with employers who advise on curriculum and provide internships for code academy students. Students don't just get a free ride, however, as they are required to volunteer on local non-profit technology initiatives and mentor newer code academy students.Code academy classes combine self-paced lessons and live online evening class meetings which ensure maximum flexibility for students. The next cohort begins later this month with more scheduled this fall. Classes are filling up quickly, so interested students are encouraged to apply on the Bay Valley Tech code academy application webpage as soon as possible: https://www.bayvalleytech.com/code-academy-application About Bay Valley TechBay Valley Tech is an inclusive free free code academy and coding bootcamp , training students in modern programming skills and connecting them with prospective employers.

    "summary": "Undoubtedly, Nashville is famous as\na music capital, but entertainment services, ethical style brands, and the\nhealth care economy are changing its reputation as a developing tech hub.\nNashville is working on its tech scene, but it may not try to be another San\nFrancisco. The ample metropolitan city gives a unique accent to tech. Tech accent incorporates its\nmusical history and serves as a roadmap for neighboring areas to attract talent\nwithout impacting their southern charm. Nashville is quickly growing and ready\nto embrace a tech boom and preserving its small-town and creative legacy. If you want to move to Nashville, you will find numerous options. Feel free to find out more about the best suburbs in Nashville to live in. however, Nashville is home to a small tech ecosystem, but it got momentum in 2020. It is becoming the fastest-growing tech sector and economy. Now, the city has a consistent stream of tech companies to expand or move to Nashville. Rate of Job Growth From 2014 to 2019, there was a 19.1\npercent increase in the Nashville metro job market. Total tech employment was\nincreased from 2010 to 2019 by 39.6 percent. Tech accounts for 5.1 percent of\nthe total economy of Tennessee. Tech expansion of Nashville shows a great\nfuture. As per experts, the Nashville tech sector can grow by 16 percent by\n2024. Tech Future of SF (San Francisco) Tech future of San Francisco is\nuncertain. Investment of venture capital in San Francisco was high in 2020 as\ncompared to 2019. Moreover, tech hiring is on the rise; however, the status of\nnew jobs is not clear in San Francisco. Remember, tech employers of San\nFrancisco announce permanent work policies and downsize their office space\nfaster. Tech Success Hallmarks Without any doubt, Nashville has\nexperienced massive bumps in the talent pool because numerous companies want to\nput roots down in the South. Fortunately, Nashville has numerous key\ningredients of San Francisco that are important for a compelling tech city. Tech Talent and University System To build innovative ecosystems,\nuniversities have great importance. In upcoming years, the global demand for\nmachine learning, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence will fall\nshort of filling positions. For this reason, tech companies need a reliable\ntalent source. The access of the bay area to top\nresearch universities gives it a competitive edge over other areas for tech\nhiring. SF is almost one hour far from Stanford University and California\nUniversity. These universities play an essential role in shaping Silicon\nValley. In the USA, California has the credit to expand five engineering\nschools. In Nashville, you may not find the\nsame schools linked with tech, and it is among the largest college towns in the\ncountry. It is home to 125,000 students in over 20 universities, along with\nprominent Vanderbilt University. Other universities are Belmont University and\nTennessee University. Similar to San Francisco, a robust system of the\nuniversity provides access to a skilled workforce. The\nworkforce of Nashville is somewhat more diverse as compared to coastal hubs,\nsuch as San Francisco. In Nashville, 26% of tech workers are women, and 23% of\nworkers are from different nations. Compared to this, San Francisco has 23%\nwomen tech workers and 9% of Hispanic or Black in the tech industry.",

    "excerpt": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:",
    "summary": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:Two days prior to Southern California and UCLA's move to the Big Ten commandeered the headlines, the league unveiled its new football scheduling model, relegating the Atlantic and Coastal divisions to the mothballs. The format is ideal for a 14-team conference, tripling the frequency of matchups such as Virginia Tech-Clemson and Virginia-Wake Forest.Starting in 2023, you'll play three rivals annually and the remaining 10 twice every four years. Contrast that to the current divisional structure, in which you face seven opponents annually and the remaining six twice every 12 seasons.But as expected, the assigning of each team's three annual rivals was imperfect. The labyrinth to balancing fairness, tradition and television appeal was always going to end in roadblocks.That reality aside, please excuse those of us lamenting the demise of annual Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake Forest clashes. The Hokies and Hurricanes have met in each of the last 30 seasons, the second-longest continuous series for both programs. Tech has played Virginia every year since 1970, while Miami has encountered Florida State each season since 1969.Moreover, Tech-Miami often matters.The 0-2 Hokies' 1995 upset of the Hurricanes in Week 3 ignited their run to the Big East title and Sugar Bowl. Frank Beamer has often called that victory the most important of his Hall of Fame coaching career.Six seasons later, No. 1 Miami survived a late 2-point conversion attempt by Tech to win the regular-season finale at Lane Stadium 26-24. 'Twas the only game decided by a single-digit margin for the eventual undefeated national champs.The Hokies authored the only top-five conquest in their history with a 2003 rout of the No. 2 Hurricanes and a year later clinched their first ACC title in the 2004 regular-season finale at Miami.And how's this for competitive? The Hokies went 6-6 versus the Hurricanes as Big East members and are 9-9 against them in the ACC, 6-6 all-time when both are ranked.Yet rather than protecting Tech-Miami's annual status, the new model, approved by a majority of conference athletic directors, designates Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wake Forest as the Hokies' yearly rivals. The Hurricanes' are Florida State, Boston College and Louisville.But for all of its history, Tech-Miami is an infant compared to N.C. State-Wake Forest.Dating to 1910, the Wolfpack and Deacons have met in each of the last 112 seasons. Four of the series' last five contests have been one-score affairs, with N.C. State prevailing 45-42 in 2020, Wake by the identical score last year.For what it's worth, the pairings I suggested in May while covering the ACC spring meetings preserved Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake. They also matched Virginia with Wake Forest, an annual opponent that I imagine most Cavaliers faithful would prefer instead of Louisville — UVA's assigned rivals are Virginia Tech, North Carolina and Louisville.As investment advisors always warn, past results do not guarantee future performance, but compiling each ACC program's aggregate conference record since 2014, when membership took its current form, at least offers an idea of how challenging each team's three annual opponents will be.Given Clemson's dominance during that span, it's no surprise that the Tigers' three yearly rivals — Georgia Tech, Florida State and N.C. State — have, on paper, the toughest draws. The remaining pairings appear quite balanced, though Wake Forest, UNC and Pitt might have caught some breaks.What follows is each program's ACC regular-season record since 2014. The number of games vary because of pandemic cancellations in 2020.Now here are the aggregate ACC records since 2014 for each team's three annual opponents.GEORGIA TECH: 117-77 (Clemson, Louisville and Wake Forest)FLORIDA STATE: 116-80 (Clemson, Miami and Syracuse)N.C. STATE: 111-86 (Clemson, Duke and North Carolina)VIRGINIA: 102-96 (Louisville, North Carolina and Virginia Tech)SYRACUSE: 100-96 (Boston College, Florida State and Pitt)BOSTON COLLEGE: 98-99 (Miami, Pitt and Syracuse)CLEMSON: 96-99 (Florida State, Georgia Tech and N.C. State)LOUISVILLE: 95-100 (Georgia Tech, Miami and UVA)VIRGINIA TECH: 94-100 (Pitt, Virginia and Wake Forest)DUKE: 95-102 (North Carolina, N.C. State and Wake Forest)MIAMI: 93-103 (Boston College, Florida State and Louisville)WAKE FOREST: 83-114 (Duke, Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech)NORTH CAROLINA: 82-116 (Duke, N.C. State and UVA)PITTSBURGH: 79-119 (North Carolina, Syracuse and Virginia Tech)Conference officials wisely presented this as a four-season scheduling cycle, 2023-26, offering hope for those who'd like to see some revisions.

    "summary": "Despite the national decline and fewer posted remote positions, tech roles remained in demand in hubs such as San Francisco, Seattle, Austin and Washington, D.C., according to a new report from Indeed. Tech jobs, like tech workers themselves, are iconoclasts. A newly released study from Indeed showed that unlike industries with businesses that were forced to shutter and suffered job losses, the major tech hubs held onto technology roles throughout the pandemic. During the COVID-19 crisis, a majority of businesses quickly transitioned from on-premises to sending their employees to work from home, yet the tech job postings in the big tech hubs were actually less likely to mention remote work than tech job listings in areas other than those major tech hubs.  For a year starting in March 2020, non-remote tech job postings became even more concentrated in big tech hubs than tech postings in general. Remote work benefited tech employers outside of the major tech hubs because, Indeed reported, there were fewer specialized tech workers in those local markets.The eight major tech hubs--Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Raleigh, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and Washington, D.C.--experienced lags in overall job postings, as did most U.S. cities, with plunges in March and April of 2020, and were challenged by slow recoveries. Indeed reported that on April 23, 2021, Indeed job postings in the big tech hubs were only 5% above pre-pandemic baselines, compared to 24% above baseline in other metropolitan areas. The eight major tech hubs are metro areas with a population of at least 1 million that had the highest number of local job postings in software development in the year before the pandemic. There are also 24 metro areas considered the smaller tech centers. These have populations between 250,000 and 1 million, and have the most local job postings in software development during the same period, the year before the pandemic. SEE: 2021 IT budget research report: COVID-19's impact on projects and priorities (TechRepublic Premium)Actual tech jobs, in software development, information technology operations and information design held up better in the big eight tech hubs than elsewhere. For job postings that cited a location, the share of tech job posts nationally in the eight big tech hubs increased minimally, from 37.46% in the year prior to the pandemic to 37.53% in the first full year of the pandemic. In Indeed reports from 2017 and 2019, the eight big tech hubs maintained or increased shares of U.S. tech jobs.Tech jobs in tech hubs were less likely to mention remote work than tech jobs elsewhere: \"In the eight big tech hubs, 16% of tech jobs mentioned remote work versus 18% of tech jobs in the two dozen smaller tech centers across the country, 19% in other big metros, and 22% in other smaller metros,\" the report found. This translates to non-remote tech job postings are now more concentrated in the eight big tech hubs than tech postings overall. And, the concentration of non-remote tech postings in those big hubs increased more during the pandemic than the concentration of tech postings overall did. Indeed cites as a key finding that \"tech jobs are at least as concentrated in tech hubs as before the pandemic, and more so when looking only at jobs where location matters enough that the posting doesn't mention remote work. The increase of remote work makes location less important for many tech jobs. But jobs for which location still matters are even more clustered in tech hubs.\"The patterns, Indeed noted, indicate that tech firms that are not in a big tech hub benefit more from remote work than the big hub tech companies, but Indeed also reminded that the big tech hubs have access to a concentration of tech workers. Employers in big tech hubs might find remote work gives employees more flexibility, and ultimately \"dramatically expands the recruiting pool for tech employers not located in the big hubs.Non-tech job postings within the tech hubs--primarily local service jobs--suffered big declines. Retail job posts were down 16% year-over-year in tech hubs, but flat outside tech hubs. Positions in childcare and food-prep declined more in the tech hubs than elsewhere. Indeed's report noted: \"These local service sectors got hit because tech hubs are full of people who can work remotely. Tech hubs have clusters of both tech jobs and related professional services jobs that can be done from home. With high shares of people working from home, local businesses like shops and restaurants have been getting less traffic. As a result, job postings and employment suffered.\"Clearly, remote jobs increased dramatically during the pandemic and Indeed job postings in nearly all sectors were more likely to mention remote work. Tech postings mentioned remote work more than postings in other industries.Within the eight big tech hubs, tech job postings fell the least in Baltimore and Austin and the most in Raleigh and Boston. Meanwhile, Seattle, San Jose and San Francisco, which all have high concentrations of big tech firms and desirable tech positions, were in the middle. Seattle and San Jose, where the biggest tech companies are headquartered mentioned the least amount of remote jobs.The result of these findings demonstrates that tech geography patterns were not much affected by the pandemic. Tech jobs fell less in areas with concentrations of tech roles, and Indeed's data showed smaller declines in the eight major tech hubs than those outside of those cities.  If you can only read one tech story a day, this is it.

    "summary": "Chinese regulators have started to tighten the leash on high-flying Chinese tech stalwarts such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).\nAn analyst at Wedbush sees this as presenting an opportunity for their U.S. peers, especially the FAANG stocks. \nHopes For Chinese Big Tech Names Evaporating: At the start of the year, Chinese tech giants were positioned to gain more investor mind share due to the complex global backdrop, analyst Daniel Ives said.\nWith the recent DiDi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) IPO fiasco and massive regulatory scrutiny by the communist regime in Beijing, a shadow has ben cast over the Chinese tech stocks in 2021, the analyst said.\nThe underperformance of Chinese tech stocks has to do with the possibility of more regulation in China around the corner, he said.\nThe U.S.-China cold tech war remains a lingering overhang on Chinese tech stocks, Ives said.\nSo far, it looks like the Biden administration is taking a much firmer stance on Beijing, tech companies/IP and the chip industry standoff than the Street was anticipating heading into this January, the analyst said.\nThe recent cyberattacks that appear to be out of China have exacerbated the growing tensions, he said. \nRelated Link: Alibaba's Ant Group Buckles Under Regulatory Pressure, Agrees To Organize As Financial Holding Company \nThe Setup For US Tech Names: These dynamics bode well for U.S. tech stocks, Ives said.\nRotation away from Chinese tech stocks and into U.S. tech creates a \"nirvana setup\" for FAANG names and the tech sector as a whole over the next six to nine months, the analyst said. \nFAANGs is the moniker given to big U.S. tech giants Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\"Our bullish view is US tech stocks will be up another 10%+ into the rest of this year with our NASDAQ 16K year-end target unchanged,\" he said. \nThe tech bull cycle will continue its upward move in the second-half of 2021 and 2022, given the scarcity of growth names, Ives said. \nHeading into second-half and with the imminent June quarter earnings season, Wedbush said it prefers owning secular winners in FAANG, cloud, cybersecurity and 5G.\nRelated Link: How Apple Neutralized Any Short-Term Weakness The Market Was Anticipating",

'Border closures are painfully impacting the\navailability of skills in the tech sector,'We have\nhad feedback from New Zealand-owned global tech firms, game\ndevelopers, IT service providers, high tech manufacturers,\nagribusinesses, universities, health boards, government\nagencies and banks. They are hurting. 'NZ tech\nfirms are having to employ more and more people outside of\nNew Zealand which is not ideal as those jobs will probably\nnever come back to New Zealand.'With more than\n20,000 tech firms in New Zealand the demand for digital\nskills has hugely outstretched supply, with vacancies\nthroughout the country.'NZTech is a not-for-profit\nnon-government organisation tasked with helping create a\nmore socially and economically prosperous New Zealand\nunderpinned by a vibrant tech ecosystem.Following its\nannual meeting late last week, NZTech welcomed its diverse\nboard with members from Air New Zealand, ANZ Bank, Deloitte,\nUniversity of Waikato, AUT and small to medium tech firms\nincluding CodeHQ, Orbica, Healthpoint, EduSystems and\nWebtools.\n\n© Scoop Media",

    "summary": "Chinese regulators have started to tighten the leash on high-flying Chinese tech stalwarts such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).\nAn analyst at Wedbush sees this as presenting an opportunity for their U.S. peers, especially the FAANG stocks. \nHopes For Chinese Big Tech Names Evaporating: At the start of the year, Chinese tech giants were positioned to gain more investor mind share due to the complex global backdrop, analyst Daniel Ives said.\nWith the recent DiDi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) IPO fiasco and massive regulatory scrutiny by the communist regime in Beijing, a shadow has ben cast over the Chinese tech stocks in 2021, the analyst said.\nThe underperformance of Chinese tech stocks has to do with the possibility of more regulation in China around the corner, he said.\nThe U.S.-China cold tech war remains a lingering overhang on Chinese tech stocks, Ives said.\nSo far, it looks like the Biden administration is taking a much firmer stance on Beijing, tech companies/IP and the chip industry standoff than the Street was anticipating heading into this January, the analyst said.\nThe recent cyberattacks that appear to be out of China have exacerbated the growing tensions, he said. \nRelated Link: Alibaba's Ant Group Buckles Under Regulatory Pressure, Agrees To Organize As Financial Holding Company \nThe Setup For US Tech Names: These dynamics bode well for U.S. tech stocks, Ives said.\nRotation away from Chinese tech stocks and into U.S. tech creates a \"nirvana setup\" for FAANG names and the tech sector as a whole over the next six to nine months, the analyst said. \nFAANGs is the moniker given to big U.S. tech giants Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\"Our bullish view is US tech stocks will be up another 10%+ into the rest of this year with our NASDAQ 16K year-end target unchanged,\" he said. \nThe tech bull cycle will continue its upward move in the second-half of 2021 and 2022, given the scarcity of growth names, Ives said. \nHeading into second-half and with the imminent June quarter earnings season, Wedbush said it prefers owning secular winners in FAANG, cloud, cybersecurity and 5G.\nRelated Link: How Apple Neutralized Any Short-Term Weakness The Market Was Anticipating",

    "summary": "1of3Seattle's Space Needle and the downtown skyline.Carl Larson/Getty ImagesShow MoreShow Less 2of3A photo illustration from Getty ImagesGetty ImagesShow MoreShow Less The Seattle metro area is the fastest-growing tech market in the nation, according to a new analysis by the CBRE real estate firm. The analysis shows that Seattle added more than 48,000 tech jobs from 2016 to 2020, an increase of 35.4%. That brings the total number of tech employees in the region to 184,660, making it seventh largest tech market in the U.S. The San Francisco Bay Area holds the top spot, with 373,430 tech employees. For comparison, the second-fastest growing tech market in the nation between those years was Salt Lake City. It added 12,680 tech jobs, growing at a rate of 33.9%. But it's total number of tech employees — 50,070 — is significantly lower than Seattle's Globally, the only big-city tech markets that grew faster than Seattle's were in Toronto, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Toronto added 81,100 tech jobs between 2016 and 2020, growing at a rate of 42.8%. Vancouver added 24,200 tech jobs, growing at a rate of 36.1%. This chart shows the biggest tech markets in cities with more that 50,000 tech employees. CBRE Edmonton, Alberta, and Waterloo, Ontario, had growth rates of 53.3% and 47.2%, respectively. However, they're considered 'small' tech markets with labor pools of fewer than 50,000 people. As for what's driving the expansion of Seattle's tech market, the analysis points to the massive growth of local tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as an increasing number of homegrown tech start-ups like Amperity, which helps brands analyze customer data. Additionally, the analysis said that major tech companies from California — including Facebook, Google and Twitter — are establishing offices at a high rate in Seattle, which drives up demand for tech employees. Overall, the analysis ranked Seattle as the second-best city for tech companies and employees. It used 13 metrics — including workforce diversity, housing costs, office rent prices and population trends — to determine each city's ranking. The top spot is currently held by San Francisco.",

    "summary": "Innovative Tech Training Program to Strengthen Central Valley Economy MODESTO, CA, U.S., August 16, 2021 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Oak Valley Community Bank (OVCB) continues its commitment to the Central Valley through a new partnership with Bay Valley Tech and Bay Valley Foundation, which will expand free software developer training for local workers seeking to pivot into lucrative tech careers. Bay Valley Tech alumni have successfully secured technology jobs at leading companies such as E&J Gallo and Tyler Technologies, as well as Turlock Unified School District and the County of Merced. OVCB recently presented a sizable donation to Bay Valley Foundation's scholarship fund which will ensure that at least 10 more deserving students are able to complete the program. 'As advocates for education throughout our community, we wholeheartedly endorse the valuable training that Bay Valley Tech provides citizens in the Central Valley. Their fast-growing software developer training program has proven to be effective in helping aspiring tech workers — many from underrepresented groups — transition into higher-paying tech jobs,' explained OVCB President & CEO, Chris Courtney. 'Bay Valley Tech is providing an invaluable low-barrier pathway to ensure workers gain entry into lucrative tech careers, while simultaneously bolstering the local economy by attracting tech employers.' As software continues to transform the global economy, creating unprecedented opportunities for skilled tech workers, Bay Valley Tech's free training program is helping local residents land these high-paying jobs. With 800 code academy applicants last year, many Bay Valley Tech alumni are now working as professional software developers. Tech diversity is strong as well — over 40% of Bay Valley Tech students are Latino and 34% are women. 'Oak Valley Community Bank's partnership will be crucial in expanding the Central Valley's tech workforce and stimulating local entrepreneurship,' stated Phillip Lan, President of Bay Valley Tech, whose programs train people to start tech businesses in addition to teaching software development. While other code academies can cost as much as $20,000, Bay Valley Tech's free program provides an excellent option for underserved communities, including working parents and others seeking entry into higher-paying tech careers. Bay Valley Tech partners with employers who advise on curriculum and provide internships for code academy students. Students don't just get a free ride, however, as they are required to volunteer on local non-profit technology initiatives and mentor newer code academy students. Code academy classes combine self-paced lessons and live online evening class meetings which ensure maximum flexibility for students. The next cohort begins later this month with more scheduled this fall. Classes are filling up quickly, so interested students are encouraged to apply on the Bay Valley Tech code academy application webpage as soon as possible: https://www.bayvalleytech.com/code-academy-application About Bay Valley Tech Bay Valley Tech is an inclusive free free code academy and coding bootcamp, training students in modern programming skills and connecting them with prospective employers. Bay Valley Tech also supports the broader tech community by sponsoring hackathons, software meetups, Women Techmakers, high school tech events and the Valley Agtech Summit. www.bayvalleytech.com About Oak Valley Community Bank With deep roots and strong branches, OVCB strengthens our local communities and economies by channeling loan dollars back in the neighborhoods where our clients live and work.

Business.org recently analyzed each state by comparing the average annual tech salaries to the salary of all occupations using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While Kentucky's average tech salary lags far behind states with more tech companies (and higher costs of living), it's still far higher than what other, non-tech workers make in the state. According to Business.org's report, tech workers in Kentucky earn an average annual salary of $75,330 and an average hourly wage of $36.21. That's 64% more than the average salary in the commonwealth, which is $46,000. Alabama, Washington and North Carolina had the highest percentage difference between tech and non-tech worker compensation, with the average tech salary all ranging between 80% to 85% higher than all other occupations. Washington, California and Washington D.C. had the highest tech salaries across the country, at $122,640, $116,820 and $113,930, respectively. As I recently reported in July, Louisville was recognized among the \"Next 25\" for emerging tech talent markets in North America in CBRE's annual Scoring Tech Talent report. The city's tech talent employment has grown by 31% in the last five years, employing a total of 19,290 tech workers in 2020. In comparing those two reports, Louisville's average tech wage was slightly higher than Kentucky's at $83,943, which was a 16% growth over the last five years.",

The analysis shows that Seattle added more than 48,000 tech jobs from 2016 to 2020, an increase of 35.4%. That brings the total number of tech employees in the region to 184,660, making it seventh largest tech market in the U.S. The San Francisco Bay Area holds the top spot, with 373,430 tech employees. For comparison, the second-fastest growing tech market in the nation between those years was Salt Lake City. It added 12,680 tech jobs, growing at a rate of 33.9%. But it's total number of tech employees — 50,070 — is significantly lower than Seattle's Globally, the only big-city tech markets that grew faster than Seattle's were in Toronto, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Toronto added 81,100 tech jobs between 2016 and 2020, growing at a rate of 42.8%. Vancouver added 24,200 tech jobs, growing at a rate of 36.1%. This chart shows the biggest tech markets in cities with more that 50,000 tech employees. CBRE Edmonton, Alberta, and Waterloo, Ontario, had growth rates of 53.3% and 47.2%, respectively. However, they're considered 'small' tech markets with labor pools of fewer than 50,000 people. As for what's driving the expansion of Seattle's tech market, the analysis points to the massive growth of local tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as an increasing number of homegrown tech start-ups like Amperity, which helps brands analyze customer data. Additionally, the analysis said that major tech companies from California — including Facebook, Google and Twitter — are establishing offices at a high rate in Seattle, which drives up demand for tech employees. Overall, the analysis ranked Seattle as the second-best city for tech companies and employees. It used 13 metrics — including workforce diversity, housing costs, office rent prices and population trends — to determine each city's ranking. The top spot is currently held by San Francisco.",

And Richmond's cost of living is objectively considerably lower than San Francisco's.\n\nPlus, the average salary for tech workers in Richmond is $98,673, compared to $53,593 for non tech workers, according to the 2021 Scoring Tech Talent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE.\n\nOf note: Richmond suffers from a 'brain drain' of tech talent, according to the CBRE report. The city produced 3,500 new tech degree graduates between 2015-2019, but it only added 1,800 new tech jobs.",

    "summary": "There's no place quite like San Francisco. With its dizzying hills, pastel Victorian houses and fog-shrouded bridges, the Californian metropolis makes for perfect postcards.\n\nBut beyond its old-world charm and chilly summers, the San Francisco Bay Area is famously known as the global center of tech innovation. Ask anyone who's taken a self-driving car through the streets of downtown: Nearly every billboard boasts software solutions, AI-powered platforms or, conversely, platforms that will tell you if something was created with an AI-powered platform.\n\nGiven San Francisco's reputation, California is usually the state that comes to mind when people think of technology career hubs. But if you're after a career in technology, you don't necessarily have to flee west. In fact, California doesn't even rank among the top three U.S. states for tech careers.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive deep into the best states for tech professionals. We'll also explore areas where tech employment is flatlining. Keep reading to discover the best and worst states for technology careers.\n\nCareers in Technology on the Rise\n\nNinety-two percent of jobs require digital skills. [3]\nNearly half of tech professionals worked remotely as of May 2022. [4]\nComputer and IT occupations are projected to grow much faster than all occupations nationwide. [5]\n\nTechnology is a fast-paced field, and tech jobs are expected to grow rapidly compared to the average projected growth rate for all U.S. occupations. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), [5] roughly 377,500 new technology jobs will open each year between 2022 and 2032. And with the proliferation of online information technology degrees and coding bootcamps, obtaining the skills needed to enter the tech industry is easier than ever.\n\nJobs in tech generally afford workers top-notch flexibility, as many of these positions can be completed from home—or anywhere with a stable internet connection. Plus, remote jobs give tech employees the flexibility to work while traveling the world (or staying put on the couch).\n\nMoreover, tech is a relatively lucrative career. The BLS reports that the mean national wage for computer and mathematical occupations is $108,130. [5] In some states, as we'll see below, mean annual salaries for tech workers are even higher.\n\nThe Best States for Tech Careers\n\nThe table below lists how each U.S. state ranks for tech careers based on a methodology that accounts for the number of tech businesses in the state, wages for tech jobs, tech employment and economic growth. We sourced data for this table from the U.S. Census Bureau, [6], [7] the BLS [1] and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. [8]\n\nTop-Ranking States for Tech Careers\n\nWashington, D.C.\nColorado\nWashington\nCalifornia\nVirginia\n\nWashington, D.C., ranked as the best place for pursuing a tech career. It's home to some of the highest-earning tech workers in the nation, with a mean annual salary of ​​$119,610. [1]\n\nWhile tech workers earn a higher mean salary in a few states, Washington, D.C., cultivates a highly favorable climate for tech workers. A little over 7% of the total workforce is employed in tech—more than any state in the country. [1] Additionally, Washington, D.C., exhibited strong GDP growth over the last five years. [8]\n\nIn Colorado, tech workers make an average of $116,620 per year. [1] The state's GDP expanded significantly in the last five years, and tech workers make up about 4.7% of the state's total workforce. [8]\n\nTech workers earn some of the highest annual mean salaries in Washington and California: $129,870 and $143,670, respectively. While California is certainly a tech epicenter, Washington outpaces the Golden State with its percentage of workers in tech. Six percent of Washington's employed population works in tech, while California's hovers at just under 4%. [1]\n\nIn Virginia, tech workers earn an annual average of $118,100. About 6.2% of the total workforce is employed by tech companies, [1] and the state GDP grew by 8% in the last five years. [8]\n\nWorst States for Tech Careers\n\nIndiana\nMontana\nNorth Dakota\nMississippi\nLouisiana\n\nIn Indiana, tech workers bring home a mean annual salary of $80,870 and make up only 2% of the state's total workforce. Tech workers in Montana and North Dakota earn average annual salaries of $83,300 and $76,900, respectively. In both states, just under 2% of the total workforce is employed in tech. [1]\n\nDespite their strong GDP growth, Mississippi and Louisiana are the two worst states for tech jobs in the United States. Workers in these states earn mean annual salaries of $75,840 and $78,720, respectively. In both Mississippi and Louisiana, only 1.2% of the total workforce is employed by the tech industry. [1]\n\nStates Where Tech Workers Earn the Most Money\n\nThe table below outlines the top 10 states where tech workers make the most money, accounting for both median hourly earnings and mean annual earnings.\n\nNationwide, tech workers earn a mean annual salary of $108,130. Average tech salaries in all of the 10 states listed below exceed the national mean. Tech workers in California are the highest earners, bringing home an average of $143,670 per year. The median hourly wage for tech workers in California is $61.87—much higher than the national median of $48.29 per hour. [1]\n\nDelaware tech workers are the 10th-highest earners in the nation. They bring in a mean annual wage of $109,040. Median hourly earnings in Delaware amount to $50.75. [1]\n\nAcross the other eight states, mean annual earnings range from $114,360 to $129,870. Median hourly wages range from $51.19 to $61.64. [1]\n\nStates With the Highest Rates of Female Employment in Tech\n\nThough the tech industry is predominantly male, some states outperform others in employing female-identifying workers. We sourced data for this section from the U.S. Census Bureau, [2] which limits its data reporting to male and female identities.\n\nNationwide, roughly 74.1% of tech employees identify as male, while only 25.9% identify as female. [2]\n\nThe following table lists the 10 states leading the nation in the employment of female-identifying tech workers. Alaska tops the charts, with 37% of the tech workforce identifying as female. [2]\n\nIn Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana and Kentucky, female tech workers make up around 29% of the total tech workforce. In Washington, D.C., the tech workforce is 31.6% female. In Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota and Hawaii, the percentage of female tech workers ranges between 32.5% and 35.5%. [2]\n\nFeatured Online Schools\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial credit and much more by clicking 'Visit Site'\n\nSources\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the best states for tech, Forbes Advisor compiled and analyzed a number of government datasets.\n\nFrom the Census Bureau's latest County Business Patterns data, [7] we used the number of business establishments that the CBP had classified as within the 'Information' industry (NAICS Code 15). We also used the total number of business establishments to determine the concentration of tech businesses in the overall economic landscape of each U.S. state.\n\nFor tech workforce metrics, we used the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2022 data to identify employment per 1,000 jobs in each state, along with median hourly wages and the percentage of the workforce employed by each sector. [1] We then compared these metrics between 'All Occupations' and 'Computer and Mathematical Occupations.'\n\nFinally, we referred to the Bureau of Economic Analysis for data on each state's overall GDP growth over the five years between 2018 and 2022 to give an indication of broader economic performance.

Job growth was slower than expected as the U.K. continued to navigate through the widespread economic impact of the pandemic, but the tech industry avoided the job losses that affected many other industry sectors in the region.The tech industry accounts for 5.5% of the U.K. economy, or £82.6 billion. Since 2016, tech employment increased by an estimated 62,140 new jobs or about 10,356 new jobs each year. \"The tech sector in the U.K. is strong and growing stronger each year,\" said Graham Hunter, executive vice president at CompTIA. \"The evidence is clear: A well-trained and certified tech workforce makes a significant impact on the nation's economy. And businesses of all sorts will need more skilled workers if we are going to maintain the growth resulting from the ongoing digital transformation efforts that accelerated during the pandemic.\"Nearly 20% of all employer tech job postings in 2021 were for positions in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain and internet of things, or jobs requiring skills in those areas.Most tech workers (591,335 employees) are tied to employers in IT consultancy and services, such as managed services providers (MSPs). Other industry sectors that are well represented include telecom, data processing and web portals (269,336); software and custom development (232,965); and tech manufacturing (109,868).\"Over the last few years, the technology industry and technology professionals have proven how vital they are to the entire nation,\" said Estelle Johannes, senior director of global communities at CompTIA. \"The drastic changes and ongoing uncertainty highlighted how important a robust technology ecosystem is to the success of the economy.\"There are 188,812 tech firms with payrolls across the UK with 44,831 tech business establishments in London. Other markets with strong tech sectors include Manchester (6,408 tech companies), Bristol (3,847) and Birmingham (3,129). Northern Ireland is projected to see the largest percentage increase in net tech employment this year, with Scotland and England following and with tech employment expected to remain steady in Wales.Other data points in the report illustrate the strength of the UK tech sector. For example:The top four metropolitan areas (London, Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow) are home to more than 572,500 tech industry and tech occupation workers, or about 1 in 3 tech workers in the region.Birmingham saw the highest increase in net tech employment year over year.Six metropolitan areas (Edinburgh, London, Bristol, Leeds, Glasgow and Nottingham) have a higher concentration of tech workers than the national benchmark of 6.3%.CompTIA's \"State of the Tech Workforce UK\" report provides data and analysis on tech employment, economic impact, technology trends, salaries, hiring activity and other measures for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and 13 metropolitan regions across the U.K. The complete report is available at here.About CompTIA The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a leading voice and advocate for the $5 trillion global information technology ecosystem; and the estimated 75 million industry and tech professionals who design, implement, manage, and safeguard the technology that powers the world's economy.

    "excerpt": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:",
    "summary": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:Two days prior to Southern California and UCLA's move to the Big Ten commandeered the headlines, the league unveiled its new football scheduling model, relegating the Atlantic and Coastal divisions to the mothballs. The format is ideal for a 14-team conference, tripling the frequency of matchups such as Virginia Tech-Clemson and Virginia-Wake Forest.Starting in 2023, you'll play three rivals annually and the remaining 10 twice every four years. Contrast that to the current divisional structure, in which you face seven opponents annually and the remaining six twice every 12 seasons.But as expected, the assigning of each team's three annual rivals was imperfect. The labyrinth to balancing fairness, tradition and television appeal was always going to end in roadblocks.That reality aside, please excuse those of us lamenting the demise of annual Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake Forest clashes. The Hokies and Hurricanes have met in each of the last 30 seasons, the second-longest continuous series for both programs. Tech has played Virginia every year since 1970, while Miami has encountered Florida State each season since 1969.Moreover, Tech-Miami often matters.The 0-2 Hokies' 1995 upset of the Hurricanes in Week 3 ignited their run to the Big East title and Sugar Bowl. Frank Beamer has often called that victory the most important of his Hall of Fame coaching career.Six seasons later, No. 1 Miami survived a late 2-point conversion attempt by Tech to win the regular-season finale at Lane Stadium 26-24. 'Twas the only game decided by a single-digit margin for the eventual undefeated national champs.The Hokies authored the only top-five conquest in their history with a 2003 rout of the No. 2 Hurricanes and a year later clinched their first ACC title in the 2004 regular-season finale at Miami.And how's this for competitive? The Hokies went 6-6 versus the Hurricanes as Big East members and are 9-9 against them in the ACC, 6-6 all-time when both are ranked.Yet rather than protecting Tech-Miami's annual status, the new model, approved by a majority of conference athletic directors, designates Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wake Forest as the Hokies' yearly rivals. The Hurricanes' are Florida State, Boston College and Louisville.But for all of its history, Tech-Miami is an infant compared to N.C. State-Wake Forest.Dating to 1910, the Wolfpack and Deacons have met in each of the last 112 seasons. Four of the series' last five contests have been one-score affairs, with N.C. State prevailing 45-42 in 2020, Wake by the identical score last year.For what it's worth, the pairings I suggested in May while covering the ACC spring meetings preserved Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake. They also matched Virginia with Wake Forest, an annual opponent that I imagine most Cavaliers faithful would prefer instead of Louisville — UVA's assigned rivals are Virginia Tech, North Carolina and Louisville.As investment advisors always warn, past results do not guarantee future performance, but compiling each ACC program's aggregate conference record since 2014, when membership took its current form, at least offers an idea of how challenging each team's three annual opponents will be.Given Clemson's dominance during that span, it's no surprise that the Tigers' three yearly rivals — Georgia Tech, Florida State and N.C. State — have, on paper, the toughest draws. The remaining pairings appear quite balanced, though Wake Forest, UNC and Pitt might have caught some breaks.What follows is each program's ACC regular-season record since 2014. The number of games vary because of pandemic cancellations in 2020.Now here are the aggregate ACC records since 2014 for each team's three annual opponents.GEORGIA TECH: 117-77 (Clemson, Louisville and Wake Forest)FLORIDA STATE: 116-80 (Clemson, Miami and Syracuse)N.C. STATE: 111-86 (Clemson, Duke and North Carolina)VIRGINIA: 102-96 (Louisville, North Carolina and Virginia Tech)SYRACUSE: 100-96 (Boston College, Florida State and Pitt)BOSTON COLLEGE: 98-99 (Miami, Pitt and Syracuse)CLEMSON: 96-99 (Florida State, Georgia Tech and N.C. State)LOUISVILLE: 95-100 (Georgia Tech, Miami and UVA)VIRGINIA TECH: 94-100 (Pitt, Virginia and Wake Forest)DUKE: 95-102 (North Carolina, N.C. State and Wake Forest)MIAMI: 93-103 (Boston College, Florida State and Louisville)WAKE FOREST: 83-114 (Duke, Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech)NORTH CAROLINA: 82-116 (Duke, N.C. State and UVA)PITTSBURGH: 79-119 (North Carolina, Syracuse and Virginia Tech)Conference officials wisely presented this as a four-season scheduling cycle, 2023-26, offering hope for those who'd like to see some revisions.

It examines whether the sector is experiencing a boom or facing a bust, offering actionable insights for investors navigating the changing landscape of the technology market in the aftermath of a global crisis.\n\nDeep Dive: Introduction In the aftermath of a global pandemic, the stock market has been a rollercoaster, especially for tech stocks. This comprehensive guide, echoing Seth Godin's clear and insightful style, aims to dissect the post-pandemic trajectory of tech stocks: are we witnessing a sustained boom, an impending bust, or a new equilibrium?\n\nThe Pandemic Tech Rally: A Historical Context The onset of the pandemic marked a significant upswing for tech stocks. Companies in e-commerce, cloud computing, and remote work solutions saw unprecedented growth. This section will delve into the historical performance of these stocks during the pandemic and the factors that drove their success.\n\nMarket Correction: A Reality Check As the world slowly returns to normalcy, tech stocks face a market correction. This section will analyze the factors contributing to this shift, including changes in consumer behavior, a reassessment of pandemic-era valuations, and the impact of global economic recovery.\n\nSector-wise Analysis: Winners and Losers Not all tech sectors are created equal. This part of the article will provide a detailed analysis of different tech sectors—such as AI, cybersecurity, and biotech—and their performance in the post-pandemic era, identifying which are booming and which are facing challenges.\n\nInvestment Strategies for the Current Market Drawing on the insights from the previous sections, this part will offer practical advice for investors. It will discuss diversification strategies, the importance of long-term planning, and how to spot potential growth opportunities in the tech sector.\n\nRisks and Opportunities: A Balanced View Every investment comes with its risks and rewards. This section will explore the potential risks associated with investing in tech stocks post-pandemic, such as regulatory challenges and technological obsolescence, while also highlighting opportunities, like emerging technologies and new market entrants.\n\nThe Role of Big Tech Big Tech companies have a significant influence on the market. This part will discuss their role in shaping market trends, regulatory challenges they might face, and what their performance indicates about the broader tech stock market.\n\nGlobal Economic Factors The global economy plays a crucial role in the performance of tech stocks. This section will examine factors such as interest rates, inflation, and international trade relations, and their impact on the tech market.\n\nThe Future Outlook What does the future hold for tech stocks? This concluding section will summarize the insights gathered in the article, offering a forward-looking perspective on the potential trajectory of tech stocks in the post-pandemic world.\n\nQ&A Section: Q1: How should new investors approach tech stocks post-pandemic?

Diversification across different tech sectors can also mitigate risks.\n\nQ2: Are small tech companies a good investment now? A2: Investing in small tech companies can offer high rewards but comes with higher risks. Investors should look for companies with innovative products, strong leadership, and sustainable business models.\n\nQ3: How has the pandemic changed investor attitudes towards tech stocks? A3: The pandemic has heightened investor awareness of the tech sector's potential and volatility. Many are now more cautious, looking for sustainable growth rather than short-term gains.\n\nQ4: What are the risks of investing in tech stocks now? A4: Key risks include market overvaluation, regulatory challenges, rapid technological changes, and global economic uncertainties affecting the tech sector.\n\nQ5: What tech sub-sectors show the most promise post-pandemic?

Investors should prepare for volatility and focus on long-term trends.\n\nQ8: What impact do global events have on tech stocks? A8: Global events, like trade policies or international conflicts, can significantly impact tech stocks, affecting supply chains, market access, and investor confidence.\n\nQ9: How do interest rates affect tech stocks?

    "summary": "CIOs Level Up Digital Offerings to Meet Demand for Consumers' Post-Covid Preferences; Remote Tech Job Postings Fuel Competition for Tech Talent NationwideCENTENNIAL, Colo., Aug. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Job postings for tech-focused roles across the economy are up 45% from January to June 2022 and up 52% compared to the same period in 2021, according to the newly released Tech Job Report from career marketplace Dice, a DHI Group, Inc. (DHX: NYSE) brand.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe overall job market for technology professionals continues to expand as organizations develop and advance their digital infrastructure to meet consumers' increasing post-Covid demand for digital access to goods and services, despite the headlines of layoffs and hiring freezes at tech-focused companies. Dice's findings show a technologist hiring spree this spring: up 44% from April to May 2022 and up 89% from May 2021 to May 2022. While there was a drop of 17% from May to June 2022, this downward trend is in line with traditional summer seasonality seen in tech job postings.\nFurther supporting the expanding job market for technology professionals, there were 60% more job postings in June 2022 compared to June 2021. The numbers tell the same story of tech job market health in comparison to pre-pandemic, with June 2022 postings up 53% vs. June 2019.While the continued strength of the tech job market may come as a surprise to some, the results are due to what appears to be a renaissance for tech talent hiring across the nation. Companies may be taking note of consumers' \"new normal\" regarding their preferences for digital options sparked by work-from-home pandemic living. These new lifestyle preferences, coupled with remote job opportunities across the country, have created a bidding war for tech talent among companies in a wide range of industries to stay competitive in attracting technologists who will lead their digital transformation.\"Our Tech Job Report shows continued strength in the tech hiring market, with job postings increasing throughout the first half of the year across banking, education, healthcare and a range of other critical sectors,\" said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. \"The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes in tech-focused organizations has not slowed down the overall demand for technologists. Moreover, we believe that current demand exceeds the available supply of unemployed technologists by at least two times.\"\nTop Tech Employers Hold Steady and Non-Tech Employers Pick up the Hiring Pace in 2022\nOf the top 50 employers of tech talent in the first half of 2022, 96% increased hiring year over year. Amazon, Apple and Google remain frontrunners as top hiring employers of tech talent, but there were also some newcomers to the list in the first half of 2022.Employers with non-tech core business models, such as manufacturing, financial services, retail and hospitality are hiring at an increasing rate. Companies including Disney, Capital One, Humana, Anthem Blue Cross, Bank of America, Deloitte, Lockheed Martin, UnitedHealth Group, Pearson, and many other non-tech companies are all recruiting technologists in growing numbers.\"The pandemic spurred a shift in consumer behavior, with a high priority placed on remote access and flexibility,\" Zeile said. \"We're seeing continued growth in tech postings for organizations that are now doubling down on their digital transformation. This surge in demand for talent to build infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity and bring organizations to the cloud, coupled with the ability to work remotely, offers a landscape of uncharted flexibility and opportunity for technologists coast to coast.\"\nTech Job Postings are Becoming Location-Agnostic and Emerging Tech Hubs Cities Rise to the Occasion\nJob postings from the first half of 2022 reflected demand for tech talent across the country as 90% of states experienced year-over-year growth for tech roles compared to the first half of 2021.Technologists' preference for remote and hybrid work persists and is propelling emerging tech hubs to the top of the lists of cities and states attracting talent. While traditional hubs such as New York City, Silicon Valley, and Austin continue to thrive, cities that have been investing in their tech scene for some time are showing unprecedented growth for tech roles.Notable Emerging Tech Hubs include:\nSan Antonio grew 80% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMiami grew 104% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMinneapolis grew 48% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nEmployers Need Technologists With Data and Cloud-Related Skills\nRelative to in-demand skills, employers are taking a holistic approach, targeting talent who can guide projects from inception to completion. There is also a growing need for tech positions with management skills and infrastructure knowledge. These skills are increasingly becoming key for employers, as it allows them to continue developing critical tech infrastructure for their businesses. As more projects are executed in the cloud, cloud computing has enjoyed the strongest year-over-year growth in job postings (162%). Demand for Master Data Engineers increased 305% when comparing the first half of 2022 to the first half of 2021.Growth of technology is a key driver of the growth of an economy, and when we look at the big picture for the U.S. tech job market, it's clear that demand for tech roles continues to increase. To dive deeper into Dice's latest Tech Job Report, read the full report here.\nMethodology\nTo present the insights in this report, Dice used job posting data provided by Dice's partner, Lightcast (formerly known as Emsi Burning Glass), which has a database of more than 1 billion current and historical job postings worldwide. Dice pulled data on July 6, 2022 and analyzed over 3 million tech job postings in the U.S. to gather our specific dataset, which Dice then filtered for \"Information Technology\" jobs that fall under \"Full Time,\" \"Part Time\" and \"Flexible Hours.\" Dice gathered the list of top employers in the \"Employers\" section by using the above criteria, with an additional filter for job postings that only derive from employer sites. The information in this report is a snapshot of tech job posting data as of July 6, 2022, and backward revisions to prior month's data may occur from the sources used in this report.\nAbout Dice\nDice is a leading tech career hub connecting employers with skilled technology professionals and providing tech professionals with career opportunities, data, insights and advice.

    "excerpt": "Almost a tenth of all employment in the region is in the tech sector",
    "summary": "Waterloo Region has one of the most concentrated tech workforces in North America, according to a new report on tech markets. Each year, commercial real estate services and investment firm, CBRE ranks the top 50 markets on the continent based on ability to attract tech talent and growth in the sector. The Scoring Tech Talent report puts Waterloo Region as fifth in the most concentrated tech workforces, finding that the local tech sector makes up 9.6 per cent of all employment in the region. Overall, Waterloo Region claims the 24th spot this year in the list of top 50 North American tech markets. Metrics like tech job concentration, tech graduation rates, and labour and real estate costs are used. At the same time, the region has the second-smallest tech force out of the list of 50 tech markets.  The list counts 24,000 local tech workers, which is actually a decrease from the 25,900 reported on the CBRE list last year. People employed in 20 key tech occupations across all industry sectors are taken into account.  At 24th, Waterloo Region also fell three spots from last year, when it first debuted on the list of top tech markets. Although, the region is still listed as the number one small tech market in North America for the second consecutive year. CBRE highlights the fast-growing local graduate population and significant cost advantages. Second on the list of top small North American tech markets is Pittsburgh, followed by Charlotte. Calgary, Edmonton, and Quebec City also make the list at third, seventh, and ninth, respectively. When it comes to the overall North American tech market list, Toronto is ranked third. Seattle takes second and the San Francisco Bay area is listed as the number one tech market. Toronto showed the biggest job gains in the report, adding 88,900 tech jobs between 2016 and 2021. Other Canadian markets that made the top 50 list are: Vancouver at 8th, Ottawa at 13th, and Montreal at 15th. According to CBRE's report, Ottawa has the highest concentration of tech workers on the continent, with tech workers making up 11.6 per cent of employment in our nation's capital.  In contrast, tech workers make up 11.4 per cent of the San Francisco Bay area workforce. CRBE also highlights Halifax, London, and Winnipeg in a list of 25 up-and-coming North American tech markets with potential. \"Canadian markets continue to be among North America's top-performing destinations for tech talent, with 11 cities well-positioned in the latest CBRE rankings,\" said CRBE Vice Chair Paul Morassutti in a release.

    "summary": "Ottawa [Canada], August 30 (ANI): Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\n \n\n\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\nThe report, titled ‘Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\n\n\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. (ANI)\nThis report is auto-generated from ANI news service.

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n \nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n \n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n \nAfter a year defined by \nmass layoffs\n among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n \nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the \nFAANG ecosystem\n) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n \nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but \neconomic volatility\n and the \nprevalence of tech endeavors\n in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n \n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n \nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in \noverall cost of living and layoffs\n that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n \nAccording to tech layoff tracker \nLayoffs.FYI\n, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, \nMeta\n, \nMicrosoft\n, \nAmazon\n, \nSalesforce\n and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n \nThis week, Google announced \nanother round of layoffs\n hitting engineering and hardware teams; \nAmazon laid off\n staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company \nDiscord cut\n 17% of its staff.\n \nLooking for the money\n \nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a \nReddit thread\n, \"I honestly care more about money and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n \nAccording to \nDice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report\n, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n \nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n \nA 2023 report from CBRE says \nnon-tech companies\n already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n \nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n \nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n \nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n \nTech job growth geographically\n \nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said. \n \n \nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n \nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. \nGitHub's 2023 Octoverse report\n states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n \nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n \nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

    "excerpt": "Wondering where to pursue or advance your technology career? Learn about the best and worst states for careers in technology.",
    "summary": "There's no place quite like San Francisco. With its dizzying hills, pastel Victorian houses and fog-shrouded bridges, the Californian metropolis makes for perfect postcards.\n\nBut beyond its old-world charm and chilly summers, the San Francisco Bay Area is famously known as the global center of tech innovation. Ask anyone who's taken a self-driving car through the streets of downtown: Nearly every billboard boasts software solutions, AI-powered platforms or, conversely, platforms that will tell you if something was created with an AI-powered platform.\n\nGiven San Francisco's reputation, California is usually the state that comes to mind when people think of technology career hubs. But if you're after a career in technology, you don't necessarily have to flee west. In fact, California doesn't even rank among the top three U.S. states for tech careers.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive deep into the best states for tech professionals. We'll also explore areas where tech employment is flatlining. Keep reading to discover the best and worst states for technology careers.\n\nCareers in Technology on the Rise\n\nNinety-two percent of jobs require digital skills. [3]\nNearly half of tech professionals worked remotely as of May 2022. [4]\nComputer and IT occupations are projected to grow much faster than all occupations nationwide. [5]\n\nTechnology is a fast-paced field, and tech jobs are expected to grow rapidly compared to the average projected growth rate for all U.S. occupations. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), [5] roughly 377,500 new technology jobs will open each year between 2022 and 2032. And with the proliferation of online information technology degrees and coding bootcamps, obtaining the skills needed to enter the tech industry is easier than ever.\n\nJobs in tech generally afford workers top-notch flexibility, as many of these positions can be completed from home—or anywhere with a stable internet connection. Plus, remote jobs give tech employees the flexibility to work while traveling the world (or staying put on the couch).\n\nMoreover, tech is a relatively lucrative career. The BLS reports that the mean national wage for computer and mathematical occupations is $108,130. [5] In some states, as we'll see below, mean annual salaries for tech workers are even higher.\n\nThe Best States for Tech Careers\n\nThe table below lists how each U.S. state ranks for tech careers based on a methodology that accounts for the number of tech businesses in the state, wages for tech jobs, tech employment and economic growth. We sourced data for this table from the U.S. Census Bureau, [6], [7] the BLS [1] and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. [8]\n\nTop-Ranking States for Tech Careers\n\nWashington, D.C.\nColorado\nWashington\nCalifornia\nVirginia\n\nWashington, D.C., ranked as the best place for pursuing a tech career. It's home to some of the highest-earning tech workers in the nation, with a mean annual salary of ​​$119,610. [1]\n\nWhile tech workers earn a higher mean salary in a few states, Washington, D.C., cultivates a highly favorable climate for tech workers. A little over 7% of the total workforce is employed in tech—more than any state in the country. [1] Additionally, Washington, D.C., exhibited strong GDP growth over the last five years. [8]\n\nIn Colorado, tech workers make an average of $116,620 per year. [1] The state's GDP expanded significantly in the last five years, and tech workers make up about 4.7% of the state's total workforce. [8]\n\nTech workers earn some of the highest annual mean salaries in Washington and California: $129,870 and $143,670, respectively. While California is certainly a tech epicenter, Washington outpaces the Golden State with its percentage of workers in tech. Six percent of Washington's employed population works in tech, while California's hovers at just under 4%. [1]\n\nIn Virginia, tech workers earn an annual average of $118,100. About 6.2% of the total workforce is employed by tech companies, [1] and the state GDP grew by 8% in the last five years. [8]\n\nWorst States for Tech Careers\n\nIndiana\nMontana\nNorth Dakota\nMississippi\nLouisiana\n\nIn Indiana, tech workers bring home a mean annual salary of $80,870 and make up only 2% of the state's total workforce. Tech workers in Montana and North Dakota earn average annual salaries of $83,300 and $76,900, respectively. In both states, just under 2% of the total workforce is employed in tech. [1]\n\nDespite their strong GDP growth, Mississippi and Louisiana are the two worst states for tech jobs in the United States. Workers in these states earn mean annual salaries of $75,840 and $78,720, respectively. In both Mississippi and Louisiana, only 1.2% of the total workforce is employed by the tech industry. [1]\n\nStates Where Tech Workers Earn the Most Money\n\nThe table below outlines the top 10 states where tech workers make the most money, accounting for both median hourly earnings and mean annual earnings.\n\nNationwide, tech workers earn a mean annual salary of $108,130. Average tech salaries in all of the 10 states listed below exceed the national mean. Tech workers in California are the highest earners, bringing home an average of $143,670 per year. The median hourly wage for tech workers in California is $61.87—much higher than the national median of $48.29 per hour. [1]\n\nDelaware tech workers are the 10th-highest earners in the nation. They bring in a mean annual wage of $109,040. Median hourly earnings in Delaware amount to $50.75. [1]\n\nAcross the other eight states, mean annual earnings range from $114,360 to $129,870. Median hourly wages range from $51.19 to $61.64. [1]\n\nStates With the Highest Rates of Female Employment in Tech\n\nThough the tech industry is predominantly male, some states outperform others in employing female-identifying workers. We sourced data for this section from the U.S. Census Bureau, [2] which limits its data reporting to male and female identities.\n\nNationwide, roughly 74.1% of tech employees identify as male, while only 25.9% identify as female. [2]\n\nThe following table lists the 10 states leading the nation in the employment of female-identifying tech workers. Alaska tops the charts, with 37% of the tech workforce identifying as female. [2]\n\nIn Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana and Kentucky, female tech workers make up around 29% of the total tech workforce. In Washington, D.C., the tech workforce is 31.6% female. In Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota and Hawaii, the percentage of female tech workers ranges between 32.5% and 35.5%. [2]\n\nFeatured Online Schools\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial credit and much more by clicking 'Visit Site'\n\nSources\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the best states for tech, Forbes Advisor compiled and analyzed a number of government datasets.\n\nFrom the Census Bureau's latest County Business Patterns data, [7] we used the number of business establishments that the CBP had classified as within the 'Information' industry (NAICS Code 15). We also used the total number of business establishments to determine the concentration of tech businesses in the overall economic landscape of each U.S. state.\n\nFor tech workforce metrics, we used the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2022 data to identify employment per 1,000 jobs in each state, along with median hourly wages and the percentage of the workforce employed by each sector. [1] We then compared these metrics between 'All Occupations' and 'Computer and Mathematical Occupations.'\n\nFinally, we referred to the Bureau of Economic Analysis for data on each state's overall GDP growth over the five years between 2018 and 2022 to give an indication of broader economic performance.

    "summary": "Wages for tech workers in Richmond are some of the lowest in the country when compared to other tech hub cities.\n\nWhy it matters: The proliferation of remote work during the pandemic created a unique opportunity for cities across the country to establish themselves as hubs for workers and jobs in the tech industry, one of the fastest growing job sectors.\n\nDriving the news: Richmond is solidly a fourth-tier city for tech compensation, according to private company data compiled by Carta, the maker of an equity management software.\n\nAnd Richmond tech workers are paid 75% of what their counterparts in San Francisco make.\n\nYes, but: Being fourth-tier and among the lowest paying probably isn't welcome news for workers, but it's exactly what tech employers are looking for in a workforce. And Richmond's cost of living is objectively considerably lower than San Francisco's.\n\nPlus, the average salary for tech workers in Richmond is $98,673, compared to $53,593 for non tech workers, according to the 2021 Scoring Tech Talent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE.\n\nOf note: Richmond suffers from a 'brain drain' of tech talent, according to the CBRE report. The city produced 3,500 new tech degree graduates between 2015-2019, but it only added 1,800 new tech jobs.",

    "summary": "New Report from The Technology Councils of North America highlights growing national tech workforce thanks to immigration-friendly national policy\n\nKITCHENER, ON, July 11, 2023 /CNW/ -- The Technology Councils of North America (  ) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN) today released \"Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since The Pandemic,\" a new report exploring globalization and migration of tech occupations in Canada. The findings highlight that between April 2022 and March 2023, 32,115 new workers came to Canada with the most migrating from India and Nigeria. This move is due largely in part to a more immigration-friendly national policy and a labor cost advantage. The report also highlighted the most attractive Canadian cities to top tech talent, with Mississauga, Ont., ranking first followed by Montreal, Que. and Waterloo, Ont.\n\nOntario boasts the largest number of tech workers within the country, but smaller provinces, like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, are experiencing the most rapid growth. Both reported the largest year-over-year growth in their respective tech workforces, at 16.3%. Windsor, Ontario has seen the highest growth in tech workers over the past year (28%), followed by Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and Timmins, Ontario. This shift is reflective of broader workforce trends, with largely remote tech workers moving away from major metropolitan areas toward more rural locations.\n\n\"Our goal at  is to serve as the collective voice of the regional tech hubs and tech associations we represent to help build the North American technology economy. This report is an important step in supporting this growth and helping our Canadian members better understand the state of the current workforce ecosystem,\" said Yvonne Pilon, Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, , and President & CEO of Windsor-based WEtech Alliance. \"Given the radical shortfall in tech workers to fill available jobs in recent years, it's imperative we understand migration movements to better serve our members, the innovation workforce, and the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nKey Findings\n\n*Migration findings from April 2022-March 2023\n\nCanada's Top Ranking Net Migration of Tech Workers by Country\n\nIndia (15,097 tech workers)\n\n(15,097 tech workers) Nigeria (1,808 tech workers)\n\n(1,808 tech workers) Brazil (1,675 tech workers)\n\n(1,675 tech workers) Ukraine (1,207 tech workers)\n\n(1,207 tech workers) Philippines (1,129 tech workers)\n\n(1,129 tech workers) Iran (1,046 tech workers)\n\n(1,046 tech workers) France (935 tech workers)\n\n(935 tech workers) UAE (744 tech workers)\n\nHong Kong SAR (715 tech workers)\n\nPakistan (588 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Largest In-Migration by City\n\nMississauga, Ontario (1,900 tech workers)\n\n(1,900 tech workers) Montreal, Quebec (959 tech workers)\n\n(959 tech workers) Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (633 tech workers)\n\n(633 tech workers) Windsor, Ontario, Canada (557 tech workers)\n\n(557 tech workers) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (525 tech workers)\n\n(525 tech workers) Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada (456 tech workers)\n\n, Canada (456 tech workers) Kitchener, Ontario, Canada (437 tech workers)\n\n(437 tech workers) London, Ontario, Canada (418 tech workers)\n\n(418 tech workers) Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (363 tech workers)\n\n(363 tech workers) Calgary, Alberta, Canada (331 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Tech Industry Workforce by Province and Territories, 1-Year Percent Growth\n\nSaskatchewan (16.3%)\n\n(16.3%) Newfoundland and Labrador (16.3%)\n\nand (16.3%) Manitoba (15.4%)\n\n(15.4%) Nova Scotia (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Alberta (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Ontario (13.7%)\n\n(13.7%) New Brunswick (12.9%)\n\n(12.9%) British Columbia (12.3%)\n\n(12.3%) Yukon (12.2%)\n\n(12.2%) Prince Edward Island (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Quebec (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Northwest Territories (9.4%)\n\n(9.4%) Nunavut (6.5%)\n\nOntario's Top 10 Global Regions of Tech Worker Net Migration (Gained Talent - Lost Talent)\n\nKarnataka, India (+797 net change)\n\n(+797 net change) Maharashtra, India (+688 net change)\n\n(+688 net change) Gujarat, India (+417 net change)\n\n(+417 net change) Telangana, India (+392 net change)\n\n(+392 net change) Tamil Nadu, India (+386 net change)\n\n(+386 net change) Ukraine (+353 net change)\n\n(+353 net change) Quebec, Canada (+309 net change)\n\n(+309 net change) Delhi, India (+290 net change)\n\n(+290 net change) Kerala, India (+246 net change)\n\n(+246 net change) Nigeria (+217 net change)\n\nWhile Canada has lost talent to the U.S. overall, net loss is not significant at only 1,672 workers. Considering the population of the U.S. compared to Canada and the total tech workforce of each, this demonstrates Canada's competitiveness to tech employment opportunities. Canada is gaining American talent from the Northeastern states, and still attracting talent from major U.S. cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. The average compensation for U.S. tech occupations per the report is $175,600 CAD ($133,500 USD), while the average compensation for the same tech occupations in Canada is $100,400 CAD ($73,897 USD).\n\n\"We are thrilled with the recent announcement by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, as it paves the way for Canada to welcome workers with H1B visas into our tech ecosystem. This groundbreaking program is set to bring 10,000 highly skilled professionals to our country, fortifying our position as a leading destination for tech talent,\" said Chris Albinson, CEO and president at Communitech. \"In addition, the Toronto-Waterloo corridor, one of North America's largest and fastest growing tech hubs, already attracts talented individuals on a daily basis, and this new initiative will propel our ecosystem to even greater heights. Equally important, the valuable data provided in this study grants Canadian teams crucial insights into tech talent migration, empowering them to make informed hiring decisions, and better serve the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nCanada's tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from BDC and combined with the findings in this data report, signify the country might be giving its southern counterpart a run for its money. The large migration of tech workers also fills the need for skilled workers amid an ongoing global talent shortage and points to a hopeful and prosperous future for Canada's tech occupation workforce.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe report is based on data sourced by labor market data and includes data points from numerous sources collected, analyzed, and visualized by eIMPACT .\n\nFor purposes of this study, \"tech talent / occupations / workers\" is defined by a proxy custom group of NOC linked occupation skill codes including roles such as Software Developers, Network and Computer Systems Administrators, and Information Security Analysts. This group of tech workers is sometimes referred to as a tech occupation cluster and tech occupation profiles.\n\n \n\nThe Technology Councils of North America () represents approximately 60 IT and Technology trade organizations that, in turn, represent more than 22,000 technology-related companies in North America.  serves its members and the industry through its strong peer-to-peer network and its regional initiatives to raise the visibility and viability of the technology industry. This is accomplished by empowering regional technology organizations and serving as their collective voice in growing the North American technology economy. More information on  can be found at: www.tecna.org or @techcouncils on Twitter.\n\n Canada's Tech Network\n\nCanada's Tech Network (formerly known as the Canadian Digital Media Network) is a network of 28 regional innovation hubs across Canada, all focused on supporting Canada's technology entrepreneurs. Designated a federal Centre of Excellence in Commercialization and Research, Canada's Tech Network is dedicated to establishing Canada as a world leader in the digital economy.\n\nMore than a group of business accelerators and incubators, Canada's Tech Network is a community of backbone organizations within regional innovation ecosystems across the country. Each Hub provides physical space, mentorship, advice and expertise to directly support Canadian firms.

    "summary": "Opening in February 2017, the Noonan Golf Facility quickly became one of the best practice facilities in all of college golf.\n\nNamed after Kim P. Noonan and Thomas Noonan, the complex has seven greens, shaped bunkers and approaches, all built with golf architect Tom Fazio's firm at the helm and former players like Matt Kuchar, Roberto Castro, Kris Mikkelsen and Carlton Forrester and others advising. The East end of the property, named for alumnus David Dorman, is designed for work on every short-game situation imaginable. Routing has been designed into the entire property for a par-3 competition course, named for alumni Linda and Ray Helton.\n\nBeyond the clubhouse, named for alum Stewart Cink and his wife Lisa, which includes lockers, showers, a kitchen area, a washer and a dryer, a refrigerator, microwave, and large television screens everywhere, there is the business of technology.\n\nInside the Kuchar Teaching Center, which includes three hitting bays, one of which is can be set up specifically for putting work, players and coaches have the ability to study their shots on video and with devices that monitor club head speed, weight on front foot vs. back foot, on toes vs. heels, club angle, ball velocity, and more.\n\nHere's a look at more college golf practice facilities.\n\nPhotos: Noonan Golf Facility\n\nNoonan Golf Facility Georgia Tech's Noonan Golf Facility.

    "summary": "CIOs Level Up Digital Offerings to Meet Demand for Consumers' Post-Covid Preferences; Remote Tech Job Postings Fuel Competition for Tech Talent NationwideCENTENNIAL, Colo., Aug. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Job postings for tech-focused roles across the economy are up 45% from January to June 2022 and up 52% compared to the same period in 2021, according to the newly released Tech Job Report from career marketplace Dice, a DHI Group, Inc. (DHX: NYSE) brand.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe overall job market for technology professionals continues to expand as organizations develop and advance their digital infrastructure to meet consumers' increasing post-Covid demand for digital access to goods and services, despite the headlines of layoffs and hiring freezes at tech-focused companies. Dice's findings show a technologist hiring spree this spring: up 44% from April to May 2022 and up 89% from May 2021 to May 2022. While there was a drop of 17% from May to June 2022, this downward trend is in line with traditional summer seasonality seen in tech job postings.\nFurther supporting the expanding job market for technology professionals, there were 60% more job postings in June 2022 compared to June 2021. The numbers tell the same story of tech job market health in comparison to pre-pandemic, with June 2022 postings up 53% vs. June 2019.While the continued strength of the tech job market may come as a surprise to some, the results are due to what appears to be a renaissance for tech talent hiring across the nation. Companies may be taking note of consumers' \"new normal\" regarding their preferences for digital options sparked by work-from-home pandemic living. These new lifestyle preferences, coupled with remote job opportunities across the country, have created a bidding war for tech talent among companies in a wide range of industries to stay competitive in attracting technologists who will lead their digital transformation.\"Our Tech Job Report shows continued strength in the tech hiring market, with job postings increasing throughout the first half of the year across banking, education, healthcare and a range of other critical sectors,\" said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. \"The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes in tech-focused organizations has not slowed down the overall demand for technologists. Moreover, we believe that current demand exceeds the available supply of unemployed technologists by at least two times.\"\nTop Tech Employers Hold Steady and Non-Tech Employers Pick up the Hiring Pace in 2022\nOf the top 50 employers of tech talent in the first half of 2022, 96% increased hiring year over year. Amazon, Apple and Google remain frontrunners as top hiring employers of tech talent, but there were also some newcomers to the list in the first half of 2022.Employers with non-tech core business models, such as manufacturing, financial services, retail and hospitality are hiring at an increasing rate. Companies including Disney, Capital One, Humana, Anthem Blue Cross, Bank of America, Deloitte, Lockheed Martin, UnitedHealth Group, Pearson, and many other non-tech companies are all recruiting technologists in growing numbers.\"The pandemic spurred a shift in consumer behavior, with a high priority placed on remote access and flexibility,\" Zeile said. \"We're seeing continued growth in tech postings for organizations that are now doubling down on their digital transformation. This surge in demand for talent to build infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity and bring organizations to the cloud, coupled with the ability to work remotely, offers a landscape of uncharted flexibility and opportunity for technologists coast to coast.\"\nTech Job Postings are Becoming Location-Agnostic and Emerging Tech Hubs Cities Rise to the Occasion\nJob postings from the first half of 2022 reflected demand for tech talent across the country as 90% of states experienced year-over-year growth for tech roles compared to the first half of 2021.Technologists' preference for remote and hybrid work persists and is propelling emerging tech hubs to the top of the lists of cities and states attracting talent. While traditional hubs such as New York City, Silicon Valley, and Austin continue to thrive, cities that have been investing in their tech scene for some time are showing unprecedented growth for tech roles.Notable Emerging Tech Hubs include:\nSan Antonio grew 80% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMiami grew 104% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMinneapolis grew 48% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nEmployers Need Technologists With Data and Cloud-Related Skills\nRelative to in-demand skills, employers are taking a holistic approach, targeting talent who can guide projects from inception to completion. There is also a growing need for tech positions with management skills and infrastructure knowledge. These skills are increasingly becoming key for employers, as it allows them to continue developing critical tech infrastructure for their businesses. As more projects are executed in the cloud, cloud computing has enjoyed the strongest year-over-year growth in job postings (162%). Demand for Master Data Engineers increased 305% when comparing the first half of 2022 to the first half of 2021.Growth of technology is a key driver of the growth of an economy, and when we look at the big picture for the U.S. tech job market, it's clear that demand for tech roles continues to increase. To dive deeper into Dice's latest Tech Job Report, read the full report here.\nMethodology\nTo present the insights in this report, Dice used job posting data provided by Dice's partner, Lightcast (formerly known as Emsi Burning Glass), which has a database of more than 1 billion current and historical job postings worldwide. Dice pulled data on July 6, 2022 and analyzed over 3 million tech job postings in the U.S. to gather our specific dataset, which Dice then filtered for \"Information Technology\" jobs that fall under \"Full Time,\" \"Part Time\" and \"Flexible Hours.\" Dice gathered the list of top employers in the \"Employers\" section by using the above criteria, with an additional filter for job postings that only derive from employer sites. The information in this report is a snapshot of tech job posting data as of July 6, 2022, and backward revisions to prior month's data may occur from the sources used in this report.\nAbout Dice\nDice is a leading tech career hub connecting employers with skilled technology professionals and providing tech professionals with career opportunities, data, insights and advice. Established in 1990, Dice began as one of the first career sites and today provides a comprehensive suite of recruiting solutions, empowering companies and recruiters to make informed hiring decisions.

    "summary": "Wages for tech workers in Richmond are some of the lowest in the country when compared to other tech hub cities.\n\nWhy it matters: The proliferation of remote work during the pandemic created a unique opportunity for cities across the country to establish themselves as hubs for workers and jobs in the tech industry, one of the fastest growing job sectors.\n\nDriving the news: Richmond is solidly a fourth-tier city for tech compensation, according to private company data compiled by Carta, the maker of an equity management software.\n\nAnd Richmond tech workers are paid 75% of what their counterparts in San Francisco make.\n\nYes, but: Being fourth-tier and among the lowest paying probably isn't welcome news for workers, but it's exactly what tech employers are looking for in a workforce. And Richmond's cost of living is objectively considerably lower than San Francisco's.\n\nPlus, the average salary for tech workers in Richmond is $98,673, compared to $53,593 for non tech workers, according to the 2021 Scoring Tech Talent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE.\n\nOf note: Richmond suffers from a 'brain drain' of tech talent, according to the CBRE report. The city produced 3,500 new tech degree graduates between 2015-2019, but it only added 1,800 new tech jobs.",

    "summary": "Waterloo Region has one of the most concentrated tech workforces in North America, according to a new report on tech markets. Each year, commercial real estate services and investment firm, CBRE ranks the top 50 markets on the continent based on ability to attract tech talent and growth in the sector. The Scoring Tech Talent report puts Waterloo Region as fifth in the most concentrated tech workforces, finding that the local tech sector makes up 9.6 per cent of all employment in the region. Overall, Waterloo Region claims the 24th spot this year in the list of top 50 North American tech markets. Metrics like tech job concentration, tech graduation rates, and labour and real estate costs are used. At the same time, the region has the second-smallest tech force out of the list of 50 tech markets.  The list counts 24,000 local tech workers, which is actually a decrease from the 25,900 reported on the CBRE list last year. People employed in 20 key tech occupations across all industry sectors are taken into account.  At 24th, Waterloo Region also fell three spots from last year, when it first debuted on the list of top tech markets. Although, the region is still listed as the number one small tech market in North America for the second consecutive year. CBRE highlights the fast-growing local graduate population and significant cost advantages. Second on the list of top small North American tech markets is Pittsburgh, followed by Charlotte. Calgary, Edmonton, and Quebec City also make the list at third, seventh, and ninth, respectively. When it comes to the overall North American tech market list, Toronto is ranked third. Seattle takes second and the San Francisco Bay area is listed as the number one tech market. Toronto showed the biggest job gains in the report, adding 88,900 tech jobs between 2016 and 2021. Other Canadian markets that made the top 50 list are: Vancouver at 8th, Ottawa at 13th, and Montreal at 15th. According to CBRE's report, Ottawa has the highest concentration of tech workers on the continent, with tech workers making up 11.6 per cent of employment in our nation's capital.  In contrast, tech workers make up 11.4 per cent of the San Francisco Bay area workforce. CRBE also highlights Halifax, London, and Winnipeg in a list of 25 up-and-coming North American tech markets with potential. \"Canadian markets continue to be among North America's top-performing destinations for tech talent, with 11 cities well-positioned in the latest CBRE rankings,\" said CRBE Vice Chair Paul Morassutti in a release.

    "summary": "CIOs Level Up Digital Offerings to Meet Demand for Consumers' Post-Covid Preferences;\n\nRemote Tech Job Postings Fuel Competition for Tech Talent Nationwide\n\nCENTENNIAL, Colo., Aug. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Job postings for tech-focused roles across the economy are up 45% from January to June 2022 and up 52% compared to the same period in 2021, according to the newly released Tech Job Report from career marketplace Dice, a DHI Group, Inc. (DHX: NYSE) brand.\n\nThere were 60% more job postings in June 2022 compared to June 2021. The numbers tell the same story of tech job market health in comparison to pre-pandemic, with June 2022 postings up 53% vs. June 2019.\n\nThe overall job market for technology professionals continues to expand as organizations develop and advance their digital infrastructure to meet consumers' increasing post-Covid demand for digital access to goods and services, despite the headlines of layoffs and hiring freezes at tech-focused companies.\n\nDice's findings show a technologist hiring spree this spring: up 44% from April to May 2022 and up 89% from May 2021 to May 2022. While there was a drop of 17% from May to June 2022, this downward trend is in line with traditional summer seasonality seen in tech job postings.\n\nFurther supporting the expanding job market for technology professionals, there were 60% more job postings in June 2022 compared to June 2021. The numbers tell the same story of tech job market health in comparison to pre-pandemic, with June 2022 postings up 53% vs. June 2019.\n\nWhile the continued strength of the tech job market may come as a surprise to some, the results are due to what appears to be a renaissance for tech talent hiring across the nation. Companies may be taking note of consumers' \"new normal\" regarding their preferences for digital options sparked by work-from-home pandemic living. These new lifestyle preferences, coupled with remote job opportunities across the country, have created a bidding war for tech talent among companies in a wide range of industries to stay competitive in attracting technologists who will lead their digital transformation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our Tech Job Report shows continued strength in the tech hiring market, with job postings increasing throughout the first half of the year across banking, education, healthcare and a range of other critical sectors,\" said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. \"The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes in tech-focused organizations has not slowed down the overall demand for technologists. Moreover, we believe that current demand exceeds the available supply of unemployed technologists by at least two times.\"\n\nTop Tech Employers Hold Steady and Non-Tech Employers Pick up the Hiring Pace in 2022\n\nOf the top 50 employers of tech talent in the first half of 2022, 96% increased hiring year over year. Amazon, Apple and Google remain frontrunners as top hiring employers of tech talent, but there were also some newcomers to the list in the first half of 2022.\n\nEmployers with non-tech core business models, such as manufacturing, financial services, retail and hospitality are hiring at an increasing rate. Companies including Disney, Capital One, Humana, Anthem Blue Cross, Bank of America, Deloitte, Lockheed Martin, UnitedHealth Group, Pearson, and many other non-tech companies are all recruiting technologists in growing numbers.\n\n\"The pandemic spurred a shift in consumer behavior, with a high priority placed on remote access and flexibility,\" Zeile said. \"We're seeing continued growth in tech postings for organizations that are now doubling down on their digital transformation. This surge in demand for talent to build infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity and bring organizations to the cloud, coupled with the ability to work remotely, offers a landscape of uncharted flexibility and opportunity for technologists coast to coast.\"\n\nTech Job Postings are Becoming Location-Agnostic and Emerging Tech Hubs Cities Rise to the Occasion\n\nJob postings from the first half of 2022 reflected demand for tech talent across the country as 90% of states experienced year-over-year growth for tech roles compared to the first half of 2021.\n\nTechnologists' preference for remote and hybrid work persists and is propelling emerging tech hubs to the top of the lists of cities and states attracting talent. While traditional hubs such as New York City, Silicon Valley, and Austin continue to thrive, cities that have been investing in their tech scene for some time are showing unprecedented growth for tech roles.\n\nNotable Emerging Tech Hubs include:\n\nSan Antonio grew 80% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nMiami grew 104% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nMinneapolis grew 48% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nEmployers Need Technologists With Data and Cloud-Related Skills\n\nRelative to in-demand skills, employers are taking a holistic approach, targeting talent who can guide projects from inception to completion. There is also a growing need for tech positions with management skills and infrastructure knowledge. These skills are increasingly becoming key for employers, as it allows them to continue developing critical tech infrastructure for their businesses. As more projects are executed in the cloud, cloud computing has enjoyed the strongest year-over-year growth in job postings (162%). Demand for Master Data Engineers increased 305% when comparing the first half of 2022 to the first half of 2021.\n\nGrowth of technology is a key driver of the growth of an economy, and when we look at the big picture for the U.S. tech job market, it's clear that demand for tech roles continues to increase. To dive deeper into Dice's latest Tech Job Report, read the full report here.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo present the insights in this report, Dice used job posting data provided by Dice's partner, Lightcast (formerly known as Emsi Burning Glass), which has a database of more than 1 billion current and historical job postings worldwide. Dice pulled data on July 6, 2022 and analyzed over 3 million tech job postings in the U.S. to gather our specific dataset, which Dice then filtered for \"Information Technology\" jobs that fall under \"Full Time,\" \"Part Time\" and \"Flexible Hours.\" Dice gathered the list of top employers in the \"Employers\" section by using the above criteria, with an additional filter for job postings that only derive from employer sites. The information in this report is a snapshot of tech job posting data as of July 6, 2022, and backward revisions to prior month's data may occur from the sources used in this report.\n\nAbout Dice\n\nDice is a leading tech career hub connecting employers with skilled technology professionals and providing tech professionals with career opportunities, data, insights and advice. Established in 1990, Dice began as one of the first career sites and today provides a comprehensive suite of recruiting solutions, empowering companies and recruiters to make informed hiring decisions.

    "summary": "BLACKSBURG — It's easy to understand why Virginia Tech's offensive coordinator Tyler Bowen is a bit enamored with Connor Blumrick.Bowen, who is building an offense that stresses 'flexibility' and 'versatility', views Blumrick as someone capable of playing just about anywhere on offense.'He brings a lot of skills to the table,' Bowen said, in June.Blumrick made an impression on the staff during winter workouts with Brent Pry mentioning him as one of the most talented players on the roster. The former quarterback moved to tight end two weeks into spring camp with the staff envisioning him getting opportunities in multiple different roles. 'He really made that transition seamless,' Bowen said. '...He's impressed me every step of the way with how he's handled the entire transition. He's got a chance to be a very multiple-player with how we are trying to use him on the offense. I've been excited about him.'Bowen isn't the only one.Virginia Tech offensive line coach Joe Rudolph, who has experience as an offensive coordinator, said Blumrick caught his attention during spring. He described Blumrick as a player that consistently made those around him better.'We asked him to do a lot of things in the spring and you see that guys have great confidence in him,' Rudolph said. 'It's kind of fun.'Blumrick spends most of his time with Bowen in the tight end room, but quarterbacks coach Brad Glenn carves out time to sit down with him. Glenn also made sure Blumrick got snaps at quarterback during individual periods throughout camp.Glenn anticipates that will continue through the fall.While there were concerns that Blumrick's slight frame might limit his reps at tight end — he's listed on Tech's roster at 6-foot-5 and 215 pounds — Bowen isn't ruling anything out.'I think you have to be creative, but I would say look across the country, how many tight ends are blocking the C gap?' Bowen said. 'Not many. Not many are doing it at the next level either.'Blumrick impressed Bowen with his physicality during the spring, and Tech's offensive coordinator thinks he would be able to handle many of the matchups at the position.'He certainly can be counted on at that position, and that lends you to get matchups in the pass game,' Bowen said. 'It's been fun growing with him and watching him grow with different roles.' When the ACC, Big Ten and Pac 12 announced ‘the Alliance' back in August, the three league's commissioners were questioned as to why there was no signed document, no binding agreement to codify just what member in the new pact actually meant. The new model will feature a 3-5-5 structure starting in the 2023 season with each team in the conference getting three primary opponents annually and face the other 10 league teams twice during the four-year cycle (once at home and once on the road).  Coach Stu Holt during the Virginia Tech Spring Football game in Blacksburg Va.

    "summary": "CIOs Level Up Digital Offerings to Meet Demand for Consumers' Post-Covid Preferences; Remote Tech Job Postings Fuel Competition for Tech Talent NationwideCENTENNIAL, Colo., Aug. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Job postings for tech-focused roles across the economy are up 45% from January to June 2022 and up 52% compared to the same period in 2021, according to the newly released Tech Job Report from career marketplace Dice, a DHI Group, Inc. (DHX: NYSE) brand.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe overall job market for technology professionals continues to expand as organizations develop and advance their digital infrastructure to meet consumers' increasing post-Covid demand for digital access to goods and services, despite the headlines of layoffs and hiring freezes at tech-focused companies. Dice's findings show a technologist hiring spree this spring: up 44% from April to May 2022 and up 89% from May 2021 to May 2022. While there was a drop of 17% from May to June 2022, this downward trend is in line with traditional summer seasonality seen in tech job postings.\nFurther supporting the expanding job market for technology professionals, there were 60% more job postings in June 2022 compared to June 2021. The numbers tell the same story of tech job market health in comparison to pre-pandemic, with June 2022 postings up 53% vs. June 2019.While the continued strength of the tech job market may come as a surprise to some, the results are due to what appears to be a renaissance for tech talent hiring across the nation. Companies may be taking note of consumers' \"new normal\" regarding their preferences for digital options sparked by work-from-home pandemic living. These new lifestyle preferences, coupled with remote job opportunities across the country, have created a bidding war for tech talent among companies in a wide range of industries to stay competitive in attracting technologists who will lead their digital transformation.\"Our Tech Job Report shows continued strength in the tech hiring market, with job postings increasing throughout the first half of the year across banking, education, healthcare and a range of other critical sectors,\" said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. \"The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes in tech-focused organizations has not slowed down the overall demand for technologists. Moreover, we believe that current demand exceeds the available supply of unemployed technologists by at least two times.\"\nTop Tech Employers Hold Steady and Non-Tech Employers Pick up the Hiring Pace in 2022\nOf the top 50 employers of tech talent in the first half of 2022, 96% increased hiring year over year. Amazon, Apple and Google remain frontrunners as top hiring employers of tech talent, but there were also some newcomers to the list in the first half of 2022.Employers with non-tech core business models, such as manufacturing, financial services, retail and hospitality are hiring at an increasing rate. Companies including Disney, Capital One, Humana, Anthem Blue Cross, Bank of America, Deloitte, Lockheed Martin, UnitedHealth Group, Pearson, and many other non-tech companies are all recruiting technologists in growing numbers.\"The pandemic spurred a shift in consumer behavior, with a high priority placed on remote access and flexibility,\" Zeile said. \"We're seeing continued growth in tech postings for organizations that are now doubling down on their digital transformation. This surge in demand for talent to build infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity and bring organizations to the cloud, coupled with the ability to work remotely, offers a landscape of uncharted flexibility and opportunity for technologists coast to coast.\"\nTech Job Postings are Becoming Location-Agnostic and Emerging Tech Hubs Cities Rise to the Occasion\nJob postings from the first half of 2022 reflected demand for tech talent across the country as 90% of states experienced year-over-year growth for tech roles compared to the first half of 2021.Technologists' preference for remote and hybrid work persists and is propelling emerging tech hubs to the top of the lists of cities and states attracting talent. While traditional hubs such as New York City, Silicon Valley, and Austin continue to thrive, cities that have been investing in their tech scene for some time are showing unprecedented growth for tech roles.Notable Emerging Tech Hubs include:\nSan Antonio grew 80% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMiami grew 104% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMinneapolis grew 48% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nEmployers Need Technologists With Data and Cloud-Related Skills\nRelative to in-demand skills, employers are taking a holistic approach, targeting talent who can guide projects from inception to completion. There is also a growing need for tech positions with management skills and infrastructure knowledge. These skills are increasingly becoming key for employers, as it allows them to continue developing critical tech infrastructure for their businesses. As more projects are executed in the cloud, cloud computing has enjoyed the strongest year-over-year growth in job postings (162%). Demand for Master Data Engineers increased 305% when comparing the first half of 2022 to the first half of 2021.Growth of technology is a key driver of the growth of an economy, and when we look at the big picture for the U.S. tech job market, it's clear that demand for tech roles continues to increase. To dive deeper into Dice's latest Tech Job Report, read the full report here.\nMethodology\nTo present the insights in this report, Dice used job posting data provided by Dice's partner, Lightcast (formerly known as Emsi Burning Glass), which has a database of more than 1 billion current and historical job postings worldwide. Dice pulled data on July 6, 2022 and analyzed over 3 million tech job postings in the U.S. to gather our specific dataset, which Dice then filtered for \"Information Technology\" jobs that fall under \"Full Time,\" \"Part Time\" and \"Flexible Hours.\" Dice gathered the list of top employers in the \"Employers\" section by using the above criteria, with an additional filter for job postings that only derive from employer sites. The information in this report is a snapshot of tech job posting data as of July 6, 2022, and backward revisions to prior month's data may occur from the sources used in this report.\nAbout Dice\nDice is a leading tech career hub connecting employers with skilled technology professionals and providing tech professionals with career opportunities, data, insights and advice.

    "excerpt": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:",
    "summary": "At the risk of violating current sportswriter code, some ACC football observations unrelated to conference realignment:Two days prior to Southern California and UCLA's move to the Big Ten commandeered the headlines, the league unveiled its new football scheduling model, relegating the Atlantic and Coastal divisions to the mothballs. The format is ideal for a 14-team conference, tripling the frequency of matchups such as Virginia Tech-Clemson and Virginia-Wake Forest.Starting in 2023, you'll play three rivals annually and the remaining 10 twice every four years. Contrast that to the current divisional structure, in which you face seven opponents annually and the remaining six twice every 12 seasons.But as expected, the assigning of each team's three annual rivals was imperfect. The labyrinth to balancing fairness, tradition and television appeal was always going to end in roadblocks.That reality aside, please excuse those of us lamenting the demise of annual Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake Forest clashes. The Hokies and Hurricanes have met in each of the last 30 seasons, the second-longest continuous series for both programs. Tech has played Virginia every year since 1970, while Miami has encountered Florida State each season since 1969.Moreover, Tech-Miami often matters.The 0-2 Hokies' 1995 upset of the Hurricanes in Week 3 ignited their run to the Big East title and Sugar Bowl. Frank Beamer has often called that victory the most important of his Hall of Fame coaching career.Six seasons later, No. 1 Miami survived a late 2-point conversion attempt by Tech to win the regular-season finale at Lane Stadium 26-24. 'Twas the only game decided by a single-digit margin for the eventual undefeated national champs.The Hokies authored the only top-five conquest in their history with a 2003 rout of the No. 2 Hurricanes and a year later clinched their first ACC title in the 2004 regular-season finale at Miami.And how's this for competitive? The Hokies went 6-6 versus the Hurricanes as Big East members and are 9-9 against them in the ACC, 6-6 all-time when both are ranked.Yet rather than protecting Tech-Miami's annual status, the new model, approved by a majority of conference athletic directors, designates Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wake Forest as the Hokies' yearly rivals. The Hurricanes' are Florida State, Boston College and Louisville.But for all of its history, Tech-Miami is an infant compared to N.C. State-Wake Forest.Dating to 1910, the Wolfpack and Deacons have met in each of the last 112 seasons. Four of the series' last five contests have been one-score affairs, with N.C. State prevailing 45-42 in 2020, Wake by the identical score last year.For what it's worth, the pairings I suggested in May while covering the ACC spring meetings preserved Virginia Tech-Miami and N.C. State-Wake. They also matched Virginia with Wake Forest, an annual opponent that I imagine most Cavaliers faithful would prefer instead of Louisville — UVA's assigned rivals are Virginia Tech, North Carolina and Louisville.As investment advisors always warn, past results do not guarantee future performance, but compiling each ACC program's aggregate conference record since 2014, when membership took its current form, at least offers an idea of how challenging each team's three annual opponents will be.Given Clemson's dominance during that span, it's no surprise that the Tigers' three yearly rivals — Georgia Tech, Florida State and N.C. State — have, on paper, the toughest draws. The remaining pairings appear quite balanced, though Wake Forest, UNC and Pitt might have caught some breaks.What follows is each program's ACC regular-season record since 2014. The number of games vary because of pandemic cancellations in 2020.Now here are the aggregate ACC records since 2014 for each team's three annual opponents.GEORGIA TECH: 117-77 (Clemson, Louisville and Wake Forest)FLORIDA STATE: 116-80 (Clemson, Miami and Syracuse)N.C. STATE: 111-86 (Clemson, Duke and North Carolina)VIRGINIA: 102-96 (Louisville, North Carolina and Virginia Tech)SYRACUSE: 100-96 (Boston College, Florida State and Pitt)BOSTON COLLEGE: 98-99 (Miami, Pitt and Syracuse)CLEMSON: 96-99 (Florida State, Georgia Tech and N.C. State)LOUISVILLE: 95-100 (Georgia Tech, Miami and UVA)VIRGINIA TECH: 94-100 (Pitt, Virginia and Wake Forest)DUKE: 95-102 (North Carolina, N.C. State and Wake Forest)MIAMI: 93-103 (Boston College, Florida State and Louisville)WAKE FOREST: 83-114 (Duke, Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech)NORTH CAROLINA: 82-116 (Duke, N.C. State and UVA)PITTSBURGH: 79-119 (North Carolina, Syracuse and Virginia Tech)Conference officials wisely presented this as a four-season scheduling cycle, 2023-26, offering hope for those who'd like to see some revisions.

    "summary": "ANI \n30th August 2023, 19:03 GMT+10\nOttawa [Canada], August 30 (ANI): Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\nThe report, titled'Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. (ANI)",

    "summary": "CIOs Level Up Digital Offerings to Meet Demand for Consumers' Post-Covid Preferences; Remote Tech Job Postings Fuel Competition for Tech Talent NationwideCENTENNIAL, Colo., Aug. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Job postings for tech-focused roles across the economy are up 45% from January to June 2022 and up 52% compared to the same period in 2021, according to the newly released Tech Job Report from career marketplace Dice, a DHI Group, Inc. (DHX: NYSE) brand.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe overall job market for technology professionals continues to expand as organizations develop and advance their digital infrastructure to meet consumers' increasing post-Covid demand for digital access to goods and services, despite the headlines of layoffs and hiring freezes at tech-focused companies. Dice's findings show a technologist hiring spree this spring: up 44% from April to May 2022 and up 89% from May 2021 to May 2022. While there was a drop of 17% from May to June 2022, this downward trend is in line with traditional summer seasonality seen in tech job postings.\nFurther supporting the expanding job market for technology professionals, there were 60% more job postings in June 2022 compared to June 2021. The numbers tell the same story of tech job market health in comparison to pre-pandemic, with June 2022 postings up 53% vs. June 2019.While the continued strength of the tech job market may come as a surprise to some, the results are due to what appears to be a renaissance for tech talent hiring across the nation. Companies may be taking note of consumers' \"new normal\" regarding their preferences for digital options sparked by work-from-home pandemic living. These new lifestyle preferences, coupled with remote job opportunities across the country, have created a bidding war for tech talent among companies in a wide range of industries to stay competitive in attracting technologists who will lead their digital transformation.\"Our Tech Job Report shows continued strength in the tech hiring market, with job postings increasing throughout the first half of the year across banking, education, healthcare and a range of other critical sectors,\" said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. \"The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes in tech-focused organizations has not slowed down the overall demand for technologists. Moreover, we believe that current demand exceeds the available supply of unemployed technologists by at least two times.\"\nTop Tech Employers Hold Steady and Non-Tech Employers Pick up the Hiring Pace in 2022\nOf the top 50 employers of tech talent in the first half of 2022, 96% increased hiring year over year. Amazon, Apple and Google remain frontrunners as top hiring employers of tech talent, but there were also some newcomers to the list in the first half of 2022.Employers with non-tech core business models, such as manufacturing, financial services, retail and hospitality are hiring at an increasing rate. Companies including Disney, Capital One, Humana, Anthem Blue Cross, Bank of America, Deloitte, Lockheed Martin, UnitedHealth Group, Pearson, and many other non-tech companies are all recruiting technologists in growing numbers.\"The pandemic spurred a shift in consumer behavior, with a high priority placed on remote access and flexibility,\" Zeile said. \"We're seeing continued growth in tech postings for organizations that are now doubling down on their digital transformation. This surge in demand for talent to build infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity and bring organizations to the cloud, coupled with the ability to work remotely, offers a landscape of uncharted flexibility and opportunity for technologists coast to coast.\"\nTech Job Postings are Becoming Location-Agnostic and Emerging Tech Hubs Cities Rise to the Occasion\nJob postings from the first half of 2022 reflected demand for tech talent across the country as 90% of states experienced year-over-year growth for tech roles compared to the first half of 2021.Technologists' preference for remote and hybrid work persists and is propelling emerging tech hubs to the top of the lists of cities and states attracting talent. While traditional hubs such as New York City, Silicon Valley, and Austin continue to thrive, cities that have been investing in their tech scene for some time are showing unprecedented growth for tech roles.Notable Emerging Tech Hubs include:\nSan Antonio grew 80% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMiami grew 104% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\nMinneapolis grew 48% in 2022, compared to the first half of 2021\n\nEmployers Need Technologists With Data and Cloud-Related Skills\nRelative to in-demand skills, employers are taking a holistic approach, targeting talent who can guide projects from inception to completion. There is also a growing need for tech positions with management skills and infrastructure knowledge. These skills are increasingly becoming key for employers, as it allows them to continue developing critical tech infrastructure for their businesses. As more projects are executed in the cloud, cloud computing has enjoyed the strongest year-over-year growth in job postings (162%). Demand for Master Data Engineers increased 305% when comparing the first half of 2022 to the first half of 2021.Growth of technology is a key driver of the growth of an economy, and when we look at the big picture for the U.S. tech job market, it's clear that demand for tech roles continues to increase. To dive deeper into Dice's latest Tech Job Report, read the full report here.\nMethodology\nTo present the insights in this report, Dice used job posting data provided by Dice's partner, Lightcast (formerly known as Emsi Burning Glass), which has a database of more than 1 billion current and historical job postings worldwide. Dice pulled data on July 6, 2022 and analyzed over 3 million tech job postings in the U.S. to gather our specific dataset, which Dice then filtered for \"Information Technology\" jobs that fall under \"Full Time,\" \"Part Time\" and \"Flexible Hours.\" Dice gathered the list of top employers in the \"Employers\" section by using the above criteria, with an additional filter for job postings that only derive from employer sites. The information in this report is a snapshot of tech job posting data as of July 6, 2022, and backward revisions to prior month's data may occur from the sources used in this report.\nAbout Dice\nDice is a leading tech career hub connecting employers with skilled technology professionals and providing tech professionals with career opportunities, data, insights and advice.

Denver advanced two spots to land at No. 10 in CBRE's 2022 Scoring Tech Talent report as North American tech-talent employment bounced back from the pandemic to post job gains across most markets in 2021. Still, the industry's resilience will be tested amid economic turmoil this year, according to the new report from CBRE. 'Denver's tech talent workforce has expanded steadily in recent years due to new job creation by local and out-of-state employers and relocation of many tech companies and tech employees to the area,' said Ryan Link, senior vice president with CBRE's Tech & Media practice in Denver. 'Specifically, we have seen strong in-migration of tech workers from the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City and Chicago.'Denver stood out in the report in several key areas: Denver's tech talent workforce of 117,620 grew by 23% from 2016 to 2021 — the seventh-biggest gain among large tech talent markets. It has the sixth-highest ratio (46.5%) of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher. The U.S. average is 32.9%.It creates nearly as many tech jobs (21,810 from 2017 to 2021) as tech graduates (22,581 from 2016 to 2020).Denver's population of millennials (ages 25 to 39) increased by 14.1% from 2015 to 2020, the seventh-largest gain among large markets. It is the third-most concentrated market for millennials at 24.1% of its population. Denver has relatively affordable real estate costs for a leading tech hub. Its average annual office asking rent is the 16th most expensive; its average monthly apartment rent is the 11th most expensive, and its ratio of tech salary to apartment rent of 20.9 is the 12th highest. The industry is taking notice of Denver's tech talent.'Fifteen years ago, there were less than five venture capital firms working with Denver-area startup companies,' Link said. 'Today, there are over 20 VC firms active in Denver's tech ecosystem. The Mile High City is now known for its highly skilled and specialized tech workforce and growing concentration of tech companies. Cracking the top 10 of this list puts Denver in elite company.'# CBRE# Scoring Tech TalentI'm a Denver-based business writer with expertise in commercial and residential real estate as well as general business news.",

    "summary": "There's no place quite like San Francisco. With its dizzying hills, pastel Victorian houses and fog-shrouded bridges, the Californian metropolis makes for perfect postcards.\n\nBut beyond its old-world charm and chilly summers, the San Francisco Bay Area is famously known as the global center of tech innovation. Ask anyone who's taken a self-driving car through the streets of downtown: Nearly every billboard boasts software solutions, AI-powered platforms or, conversely, platforms that will tell you if something was created with an AI-powered platform.\n\nGiven San Francisco's reputation, California is usually the state that comes to mind when people think of technology career hubs. But if you're after a career in technology, you don't necessarily have to flee west. In fact, California doesn't even rank among the top three U.S. states for tech careers.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive deep into the best states for tech professionals. We'll also explore areas where tech employment is flatlining. Keep reading to discover the best and worst states for technology careers.\n\nCareers in Technology on the Rise\n\nNinety-two percent of jobs require digital skills. [3]\nNearly half of tech professionals worked remotely as of May 2022. [4]\nComputer and IT occupations are projected to grow much faster than all occupations nationwide. [5]\n\nTechnology is a fast-paced field, and tech jobs are expected to grow rapidly compared to the average projected growth rate for all U.S. occupations. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), [5] roughly 377,500 new technology jobs will open each year between 2022 and 2032. And with the proliferation of online information technology degrees and coding bootcamps, obtaining the skills needed to enter the tech industry is easier than ever.\n\nJobs in tech generally afford workers top-notch flexibility, as many of these positions can be completed from home—or anywhere with a stable internet connection. Plus, remote jobs give tech employees the flexibility to work while traveling the world (or staying put on the couch).\n\nMoreover, tech is a relatively lucrative career. The BLS reports that the mean national wage for computer and mathematical occupations is $108,130. [5] In some states, as we'll see below, mean annual salaries for tech workers are even higher.\n\nThe Best States for Tech Careers\n\nThe table below lists how each U.S. state ranks for tech careers based on a methodology that accounts for the number of tech businesses in the state, wages for tech jobs, tech employment and economic growth. We sourced data for this table from the U.S. Census Bureau, [6], [7] the BLS [1] and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. [8]\n\nTop-Ranking States for Tech Careers\n\nWashington, D.C.\nColorado\nWashington\nCalifornia\nVirginia\n\nWashington, D.C., ranked as the best place for pursuing a tech career. It's home to some of the highest-earning tech workers in the nation, with a mean annual salary of ​​$119,610. [1]\n\nWhile tech workers earn a higher mean salary in a few states, Washington, D.C., cultivates a highly favorable climate for tech workers. A little over 7% of the total workforce is employed in tech—more than any state in the country. [1] Additionally, Washington, D.C., exhibited strong GDP growth over the last five years. [8]\n\nIn Colorado, tech workers make an average of $116,620 per year. [1] The state's GDP expanded significantly in the last five years, and tech workers make up about 4.7% of the state's total workforce. [8]\n\nTech workers earn some of the highest annual mean salaries in Washington and California: $129,870 and $143,670, respectively. While California is certainly a tech epicenter, Washington outpaces the Golden State with its percentage of workers in tech. Six percent of Washington's employed population works in tech, while California's hovers at just under 4%. [1]\n\nIn Virginia, tech workers earn an annual average of $118,100. About 6.2% of the total workforce is employed by tech companies, [1] and the state GDP grew by 8% in the last five years. [8]\n\nWorst States for Tech Careers\n\nIndiana\nMontana\nNorth Dakota\nMississippi\nLouisiana\n\nIn Indiana, tech workers bring home a mean annual salary of $80,870 and make up only 2% of the state's total workforce. Tech workers in Montana and North Dakota earn average annual salaries of $83,300 and $76,900, respectively. In both states, just under 2% of the total workforce is employed in tech. [1]\n\nDespite their strong GDP growth, Mississippi and Louisiana are the two worst states for tech jobs in the United States. Workers in these states earn mean annual salaries of $75,840 and $78,720, respectively. In both Mississippi and Louisiana, only 1.2% of the total workforce is employed by the tech industry. [1]\n\nStates Where Tech Workers Earn the Most Money\n\nThe table below outlines the top 10 states where tech workers make the most money, accounting for both median hourly earnings and mean annual earnings.\n\nNationwide, tech workers earn a mean annual salary of $108,130. Average tech salaries in all of the 10 states listed below exceed the national mean. Tech workers in California are the highest earners, bringing home an average of $143,670 per year. The median hourly wage for tech workers in California is $61.87—much higher than the national median of $48.29 per hour. [1]\n\nDelaware tech workers are the 10th-highest earners in the nation. They bring in a mean annual wage of $109,040. Median hourly earnings in Delaware amount to $50.75. [1]\n\nAcross the other eight states, mean annual earnings range from $114,360 to $129,870. Median hourly wages range from $51.19 to $61.64. [1]\n\nStates With the Highest Rates of Female Employment in Tech\n\nThough the tech industry is predominantly male, some states outperform others in employing female-identifying workers. We sourced data for this section from the U.S. Census Bureau, [2] which limits its data reporting to male and female identities.\n\nNationwide, roughly 74.1% of tech employees identify as male, while only 25.9% identify as female. [2]\n\nThe following table lists the 10 states leading the nation in the employment of female-identifying tech workers. Alaska tops the charts, with 37% of the tech workforce identifying as female. [2]\n\nIn Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana and Kentucky, female tech workers make up around 29% of the total tech workforce. In Washington, D.C., the tech workforce is 31.6% female. In Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota and Hawaii, the percentage of female tech workers ranges between 32.5% and 35.5%. [2]\n\nFeatured Online Schools\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial credit and much more by clicking 'Visit Site'\n\nSources\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the best states for tech, Forbes Advisor compiled and analyzed a number of government datasets.\n\nFrom the Census Bureau's latest County Business Patterns data, [7] we used the number of business establishments that the CBP had classified as within the 'Information' industry (NAICS Code 15). We also used the total number of business establishments to determine the concentration of tech businesses in the overall economic landscape of each U.S. state.\n\nFor tech workforce metrics, we used the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2022 data to identify employment per 1,000 jobs in each state, along with median hourly wages and the percentage of the workforce employed by each sector. [1] We then compared these metrics between 'All Occupations' and 'Computer and Mathematical Occupations.'\n\nFinally, we referred to the Bureau of Economic Analysis for data on each state's overall GDP growth over the five years between 2018 and 2022 to give an indication of broader economic performance.

    "summary": "SAN JOSE — The massive tech layoffs that have jolted the Bay Area job market have primarily affected non-tech employees of the companies that orchestrated the local job cuts, a new report released Tuesday states.\n\n\nThe new CBRE report — which determined that the Bay Area is the nation's top region for tech talent — offers a fresh look at the nature of the tech layoffs that have haunted the Bay Area economy for more than 18 months.\n\n\n'Even as the tech sector's resilience was tested in 2022, the (Bay Area) region continues to lead with the largest tech talent labor pool and highest number of tech roles of any U.S. market,' stated the new 'Scoring Tech Talent' report from CBRE, a commercial real estate firm.\n\n\nApple Park complex in Cupertino that is the headquarters of Apple, seen in the upper section of the image. The Steve Jobs Theater is in the lower right. \n\n\nThe CBRE report for the first time examined and compared wages in key tech regions. The Bay Area is the location for the nation's highest-paid tech workers.\n\n\nIn 2021, annual tech wages averaged $185,425 in the Bay Area, $172,009 in Seattle and $121,794 in Boston, CBRE determined.\n\n\nTucked away in the new report was an overall assessment of the nature of the tech industry layoffs that have occurred in the Bay Area, a bout of job cuts that began at the outset of 2022.\n \nPeople stand in front of a sign with the Meta Platforms logo on Hacker Way in Menlo Park. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group)\n\n\n'Many Bay Area tech employers slowed hiring and made staff reductions, but most layoffs are affecting non-tech roles like marketing, finance and recruiting,' said Chris Shepherd, an executive vice president in CBRE's tech and media practice.\n\n\nFrom January 2022 through mid-July 2023, a period of slightly more than 18 months, tech companies have revealed plans to chop more than 26,000 jobs in the Bay Area.\n \nDespite the massive nature of the job cuts, tech companies appear to be using scalpels rather than butcher knives to trim their workforces and reallocate employees.\n\n\n'Many companies continue to hold on to their engineering talent,' Shepherd said.\n\n\nPlus, signs have emerged that the Bay Area's ever-restless technology industry is taking the initial steps to harvest more promising fields.\n\n\n'We are seeing new start-up companies emerge, a potential sign that we are entering a new cycle,' Shepherd said. 'Recruiting and retaining tech talent remains a priority for many companies, in addition to creating an attractive office experience for employees.'\n\n\nTech companies are thought to be redeploying resources already, CBRE's report indicated.\n\n\n'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech,' said Colin Yasukochi, executive director of CBRE's tech insights center. 'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech.'",

While the global net in-migration of tech talent came primarily from India, Nigeria, and Brazil, Canada is also gaining American talent, which includes Indians, from major US cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, the report said. In a bid to attract top tech talent to the country, Canada has started giving open work permits for H1-B visa holders from the US. Indians, who account for nearly 75 per cent of H1-B visa holders in the US, will be the major beneficiaries of this scheme. \nCanada's tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from the \nBusiness Development Bank of Canada\n. \nRevenues in the tech sector grew at an average annual pace of 9.4 per cent between 2015 and 2020, and in 2022, Canada had more than 400,000 software developers in the country. \nThe report also found that the most sought-after tech skills in Canada include customer experience, \nMicrosoft Azure\n, analytical skills, \nAmazon\n web services, \nJira\n, data science, \nGitHub\n, and Customer Relationship Management.\n \n \n \nPublished On Aug 30, 2023 at 08:05 AM IST",

    "excerpt": "Canada's Tech Talent Strategy aims to draw global tech talent to the country, but faces hurdles like U.S. salary competition and high living costs.",
    "summary": "The Canadian government has announced a new strategy to entice tech workers from around the globe to work in Canada. The Tech Talent Strategy was announced by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser at the Collision technology conference in Toronto on June 27.\n\nThe new strategy is embedded within the broader Global Skills Strategy program that helps businesses hire skilled workers from around the world.\n\nThe Tech Talent Strategy is built on several key pillars, including creating a work permit stream for U.S. H-1B visa holders to work in Canada, expanding the International Mobility Program, promoting Canada as a destination for ' digital nomads ' and improving the Start-up Visa Program.\n\nThese pillars are designed to ensure that Canada is not only filling in-demand jobs, but also attracting the talent necessary to create the jobs of tomorrow.\n\nHowever, despite the commendable vision, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges that could impede the Tech Talent Strategy's success.\n\nNew visa work permit\n\nAs part of the new strategy, the federal government will open a work permit stream for American H-1B visa holders to work in Canada. The H-1B visa program allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialized occupations.\n\nThe H-1B visa acts as a powerful magnet for tech professionals, who are enticed by the opportunities and salaries afforded by the U.S. tech industry.\n\nThis part of the strategy prompts a critical question: Can Canada really compete with the U.S. in the tech realm?\n\nThe U.S. tech industry is famed for its high salaries, making the financial aspect a significant consideration for H-1B recipients contemplating a move to Canada.\n\nCanada versus U.S. tech firms\n\nA 2022 tech industry salary report found that entry-level engineers at top companies in New York and San Francisco earned around US$274,000 and US$266,000 respectively. While Canada's tech industry is growing rapidly, it still has some way to go to match these salary levels.\n\nAdditionally, the disparity in scale between the tech industries in Canada and the U.S. presents another significant hurdle. The Canadian tech sector is still overshadowed by the size and influence of its American counterpart.\n\nShopify, one of the largest tech companies in Canada, is still significantly smaller than U.S. tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon that all have market caps surpassing US$1 trillion. In comparison, Shopify's market cap is only C$193.6 billion.\n\nCanadian tech firms also face challenges when it comes to scaling up their operations to compete with U.S. firms. These challenges include finding and retaining talent, managing cash flow, maintaining a consistent company culture and dealing with increased competition.\n\nBecause Canadian tech firms often face challenges in scaling up due to a lack of capital-rich markets, they often move to the U.S. to access its tech sector infrastructure.\n\nThe stark differences in scale between Canadian and U.S. tech firms could affect the effectiveness and appeal of Canada's Tech Talent Strategy.\n\nLocal impacts\n\nAnother potential pitfall lies in the strategy's local impacts. Encouraging an influx of foreign workers in a highly competitive industry like tech could inadvertently sideline local talent. Striking a balance between the interests of foreign tech professionals and local workers is paramount.\n\nIn addition, Canada's ambitious goal of admitting 500,000 immigrants a year by 2025 adds another layer of complexity to these challenges.\n\nThis immigration target could strain the local job market, especially in the tech sector. The Tech Talent Strategy must ensure it complements, rather than competes with, the development of local talent to create a harmonious tech ecosystem that benefits all.\n\nSubstantial infrastructure and resources are needed to sustain such an increase. Careful planning and investments are needed.\n\nProceed with caution\n\nWhile Canada's Tech Talent Strategy marks a promising development, it is far from a smooth ride. The success of this ambitious project hinges on numerous factors, including attracting H-1B visa holders, fulfilling immigration targets and balancing the needs of foreign and local workers.\n\nThis complex endeavour demands careful, strategic planning and execution. To ensure the strategy's success, Canada needs to nurture more homegrown tech companies, restructure the industry's scale, improve access to funding for tech firms and invest in local tech talent education.\n\nWith these strategies in place, Canada can genuinely foster a balanced tech ecosystem characterized by a diverse mix of small, medium and large companies, a network of tech-savvy investors and a system that balances immigration and local talent development.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see how the strategy evolves and the ensuing impact on Canada's tech industry and the broader economy.",

While Texas Tech faithful continue to hold on to the Michael Crabtree catch in 2008, Texas holds a 54-17 record over the Red Raiders.\n\nSteve Sarkisian is 1-0 over Texas Tech as the Texas head coach. The Horns put up a whopping 70 points in the win a season ago.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire is making his Big 12 Conference debut on Saturday. He has Tech off to a 2-1 start with an impressive overtime victory over Houston. Pulling off the upset against Texas would be a dream start to his Texas Tech tenure.\n\nThe future of this game is in question with Texas' upcoming move to the SEC. The two schools have been in the same league since the begging of the Southwest Conference in 1960.\n\nAs Texas prepares to travel to Lubbock this weekend, let us take a glimpse back at the last 10 matchups between Texas and Texas Tech.\n\nNov. 3, 2012: Texas at Texas Tech\n\nMichael C.

Tech 9-4, Florida State 7-6\nHow To Watch\nWhat to Know\n We've got another exciting ACC matchup on schedule as the Va. Tech Hokies and the Florida State Seminoles are set to tip at 4:00 p.m. ET on January 6th at Donald L. Tucker Center. Va. Tech might want some stickum for this matchup since the team gave up 19 turnovers on Saturday.\n Va. Tech unfortunately witnessed the end of their four-game winning streak. Their painful 86-63 loss to the Demon Deacons might stick with them for a while. Va. Tech was in a tough position after the first half, with the score already sitting at 44-24.\n Va. Tech's loss shouldn't obscure the performances of Hunter Cattoor, who scored 14 points along with six rebounds, and Tyler Nickel who scored 11 points.\n Meanwhile, the Seminoles rang in the new year with a 82-71 win over the Yellow Jackets on Wednesday.\n Florida State can attribute much of their success to Chandler Jackson, who scored 14 points. As a matter of fact, that's the most points Jackson has scored all season.\n The Hokies' defeat dropped their record down to 9-4. As for the Seminoles, they now have a winning record of 7-6.\n Va. Tech took their win against Florida State in their previous meeting back in March of 2023 by a conclusive 82-60. The rematch might be a little tougher for Va. Tech since the team won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.\n\n\nSeries History\nFlorida State has won 6 out of their last 10 games against Va. Tech.\nMar 04, 2023 - Va. Tech 82 vs. Florida State 60\nJan 29, 2022 - Va. Tech 85 vs. Florida State 72\nFeb 01, 2020 - Florida State 74 vs. Va. Tech 63\nMar 14, 2019 - Florida State 65 vs. Va.

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n\nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n\nAfter a year defined by mass layoffs among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the FAANG ecosystem) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n\nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but economic volatility and the prevalence of tech endeavors in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n\nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in overall cost of living and layoffs that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n\nAccording to tech layoff tracker Layoffs.FYI, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n\nThis week, Google announced another round of layoffs hitting engineering and hardware teams; Amazon laid off staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company Discord cut 17% of its staff.\n\nLooking for the \n\nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a Reddit thread, \"I honestly care more about  and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n\nAccording to Dice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n\nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n\nA 2023 report from CBRE says non-tech companies already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n\nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n\nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n\nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n\nTech job growth geographically\n\nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said.\n\nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n\nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. GitHub's 2023 Octoverse report states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n\nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n\nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

    "summary": "Ottawa [Canada], August 30 (ANI): Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\n \n\n\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation.

Tech Hokies and the Florida State Seminoles are set to tip at 4:00 p.m. ET on January 6th at Donald L. Tucker Center. Va. Tech might want some stickum for this matchup since the team gave up 19 turnovers on Saturday.\n Va. Tech unfortunately witnessed the end of their four-game winning streak. Their painful 86-63 loss to the Demon Deacons might stick with them for a while. Va. Tech was in a tough position after the first half, with the score already sitting at 44-24.\n Va. Tech's loss shouldn't obscure the performances of Hunter Cattoor, who scored 14 points along with six rebounds, and Tyler Nickel who scored 11 points.\n Meanwhile, the Seminoles rang in the new year with a 82-71 win over the Yellow Jackets on Wednesday.\n Florida State can attribute much of their success to Chandler Jackson, who scored 14 points. As a matter of fact, that's the most points Jackson has scored all season.\n The Hokies' defeat dropped their record down to 9-4. As for the Seminoles, they now have a winning record of 7-6.\n Va. Tech took their win against Florida State in their previous meeting back in March of 2023 by a conclusive 82-60. The rematch might be a little tougher for Va. Tech since the team won't have the home-court advantage this time around.

    "excerpt": "Canada's Tech Talent Strategy aims to draw global tech talent to the country, but faces hurdles like U.S. salary competition and high living costs.",
    "summary": "The Canadian government has announced a new strategy to entice tech workers from around the globe to work in Canada. The Tech Talent Strategy was announced by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser at the Collision technology conference in Toronto on June 27.\n\nThe new strategy is embedded within the broader Global Skills Strategy program that helps businesses hire skilled workers from around the world.\n\nThe Tech Talent Strategy is built on several key pillars, including creating a work permit stream for U.S. H-1B visa holders to work in Canada, expanding the International Mobility Program, promoting Canada as a destination for ' digital nomads ' and improving the Start-up Visa Program.\n\nThese pillars are designed to ensure that Canada is not only filling in-demand jobs, but also attracting the talent necessary to create the jobs of tomorrow.\n\nHowever, despite the commendable vision, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges that could impede the Tech Talent Strategy's success.\n\nNew visa work permit\n\nAs part of the new strategy, the federal government will open a work permit stream for American H-1B visa holders to work in Canada. The H-1B visa program allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialized occupations.\n\nThe H-1B visa acts as a powerful magnet for tech professionals, who are enticed by the opportunities and salaries afforded by the U.S. tech industry.\n\nThis part of the strategy prompts a critical question: Can Canada really compete with the U.S. in the tech realm?\n\nThe U.S. tech industry is famed for its high salaries, making the financial aspect a significant consideration for H-1B recipients contemplating a move to Canada.\n\nCanada versus U.S. tech firms\n\nA 2022 tech industry salary report found that entry-level engineers at top companies in New York and San Francisco earned around US$274,000 and US$266,000 respectively. While Canada's tech industry is growing rapidly, it still has some way to go to match these salary levels.\n\nAdditionally, the disparity in scale between the tech industries in Canada and the U.S. presents another significant hurdle. The Canadian tech sector is still overshadowed by the size and influence of its American counterpart.\n\nShopify, one of the largest tech companies in Canada, is still significantly smaller than U.S. tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon that all have market caps surpassing US$1 trillion. In comparison, Shopify's market cap is only C$193.6 billion.\n\nCanadian tech firms also face challenges when it comes to scaling up their operations to compete with U.S. firms. These challenges include finding and retaining talent, managing cash flow, maintaining a consistent company culture and dealing with increased competition.\n\nBecause Canadian tech firms often face challenges in scaling up due to a lack of capital-rich markets, they often move to the U.S. to access its tech sector infrastructure.\n\nThe stark differences in scale between Canadian and U.S. tech firms could affect the effectiveness and appeal of Canada's Tech Talent Strategy.\n\nLocal impacts\n\nAnother potential pitfall lies in the strategy's local impacts. Encouraging an influx of foreign workers in a highly competitive industry like tech could inadvertently sideline local talent. Striking a balance between the interests of foreign tech professionals and local workers is paramount.\n\nIn addition, Canada's ambitious goal of admitting 500,000 immigrants a year by 2025 adds another layer of complexity to these challenges.\n\nThis immigration target could strain the local job market, especially in the tech sector. The Tech Talent Strategy must ensure it complements, rather than competes with, the development of local talent to create a harmonious tech ecosystem that benefits all.\n\nSubstantial infrastructure and resources are needed to sustain such an increase. Careful planning and investments are needed.\n\nProceed with caution\n\nWhile Canada's Tech Talent Strategy marks a promising development, it is far from a smooth ride. The success of this ambitious project hinges on numerous factors, including attracting H-1B visa holders, fulfilling immigration targets and balancing the needs of foreign and local workers.\n\nThis complex endeavour demands careful, strategic planning and execution. To ensure the strategy's success, Canada needs to nurture more homegrown tech companies, restructure the industry's scale, improve access to funding for tech firms and invest in local tech talent education.\n\nWith these strategies in place, Canada can genuinely foster a balanced tech ecosystem characterized by a diverse mix of small, medium and large companies, a network of tech-savvy investors and a system that balances immigration and local talent development.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see how the strategy evolves and the ensuing impact on Canada's tech industry and the broader economy.",

    "summary": "Opening in February 2017, the Noonan Golf Facility quickly became one of the best practice facilities in all of college golf.\n\nNamed after Kim P. Noonan and Thomas Noonan, the complex has seven greens, shaped bunkers and approaches, all built with golf architect Tom Fazio's firm at the helm and former players like Matt Kuchar, Roberto Castro, Kris Mikkelsen and Carlton Forrester and others advising. The East end of the property, named for alumnus David Dorman, is designed for work on every short-game situation imaginable. Routing has been designed into the entire property for a par-3 competition course, named for alumni Linda and Ray Helton.\n\nBeyond the clubhouse, named for alum Stewart Cink and his wife Lisa, which includes lockers, showers, a kitchen area, a washer and a dryer, a refrigerator, microwave, and large television screens everywhere, there is the business of technology.\n\nInside the Kuchar Teaching Center, which includes three hitting bays, one of which is can be set up specifically for putting work, players and coaches have the ability to study their shots on video and with devices that monitor club head speed, weight on front foot vs. back foot, on toes vs. heels, club angle, ball velocity, and more.\n\nHere's a look at more college golf practice facilities.\n\nPhotos: Noonan Golf Facility\n\nNoonan Golf Facility Georgia Tech's Noonan Golf Facility.

Regional restrictions may apply.)\n\nfuboTV (Try for free. Regional restrictions may apply.) Ticket Cost: $40.00\n\nWhat to Know\n\nWe've got another exciting ACC matchup on schedule as the Va. Tech Hokies and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are set to tip at 5:00 p.m. ET on January 27th at Cassell Coliseum. Va. Tech will be strutting in after a win while Georgia Tech will be stumbling in from a defeat.\n\nLast Tuesday, the Hokies earned a 76-71 win over the Eagles. The victory made it back-to-back wins for Va. Tech.\n\nVa. Tech can attribute much of their success to Hunter Cattoor, who scored 17 points along with three steals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yellow Jackets came up short against the Panthers on Tuesday and fell 72-64. The loss unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Georgia Tech in their matchups with Pittsburgh: they've now lost four in a row.\n\nDespite their defeat, Georgia Tech saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays. Kyle Sturdivant, who scored 14 points, was perhaps the best of all. Another player making a difference was Kowacie Reeves Jr., who scored 15 points along with five rebounds.\n\nThe Hokies' victory bumped their record up to 12-7. As for the Yellow Jackets, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost seven of their last eight matches, which put a noticeable dent in their 9-10 record this season.\n\nLooking forward to Saturday, Va.

    "summary": "Representational Image. \n \n \nOver 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\n\n\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\n\n\n \nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\n\n\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. \n\n\nMississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\nThe report, titled ‘Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\n\n\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n \n Published on: \n August 30, 2023 17:26:17 IST",

    "summary": "Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox. This surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry. Following India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more. Mississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\nThe report, titled 'Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox. The migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

    "summary": "ANI \n30th August 2023, 19:03 GMT+10\nOttawa [Canada], August 30 (ANI): Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\nThe report, titled'Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. (ANI)",

    "summary": "SAN JOSE — The massive tech layoffs that have jolted the Bay Area job market have primarily affected non-tech employees of the companies that have orchestrated the local job cuts, a new report released Tuesday states.\n\nThe new CBRE report — which determined that the Bay Area is the nation's top region for tech talent — offers a fresh look at the nature of the tech layoffs that have haunted the Bay Area economy for more than 18 months.\n\n'Even as the tech sector's resilience was tested in 2022, the (Bay Area) region continues to lead with the largest tech talent labor pool and highest number of tech roles of any U.S. market,' stated the new 'Scoring Tech Talent' report from CBRE, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nThe CBRE report for the first time examined and compared wages in key tech regions. The Bay Area is paying the highest wages for tech workers.\n\nIn 2021, annual tech wages averaged $185,425 in the Bay Area, $172,009 in Seattle and $121,794 in Boston, CBRE determined.\n\nTucked away in the new report was an overall assessment of the nature of the tech industry layoffs that have occurred in the Bay Area, a bout of job cuts that began at the outset of 2022.\n\n'Many Bay Area tech employers slowed hiring and made staff reductions, but most layoffs are affecting non-tech roles like marketing, finance and recruiting,' said Chris Shephard, an executive vice president in CBRE's tech and media practice.\n\nFrom January 2022 through mid-July 2023, a period of slightly more than 18 months, tech companies have revealed plans to chop more than 26,000 jobs in the Bay Area.\n\nDespite the massive nature of the job cuts, tech companies appear to be using scalpels rather than butcher knives to trim their workforces and reallocate employees.\n\n'Many companies continue to hold on to their engineering talent,' Shephard said.\n\nPlus, signs have emerged that the Bay Area's ever-restless technology industry is taking the initial steps to harvest more promising fields.\n\n'We are seeing new start-up companies emerge, a potential sign that we are entering a new cycle,' Shephard said. 'Recruiting and retaining tech talent remains a priority for many companies, in addition to creating an attractive office experience for employees.'\n\nTech companies are thought to be redeploying resources already, CBRE's report indicated.\n\n'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech,' said Colin Yasukochi, executive director of CBRE's tech insights center. 'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech.'",

Experts attribute this phenomenon to \n\n's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\n \nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.Mississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\nThe report, titled ‘Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for \n\n's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, \n\n is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. (ANI)",

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n\nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n\nAfter a year defined by mass layoffs among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the FAANG ecosystem) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n\nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but economic volatility and the prevalence of tech endeavors in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n\nGet Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n\nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in overall cost of living and layoffs that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n\nAccording to tech layoff tracker Layoffs.FYI, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n\nThis week, Google announced another round of layoffs hitting engineering and hardware teams; Amazon laid off staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company Discord cut 17% of its staff.\n\nLooking for the money\n\nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a Reddit thread, \"I honestly care more about money and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n\nAccording to Dice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n\nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n\nA 2023 report from CBRE says non-tech companies already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n\nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n\nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n\nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n\nTech job growth geographically\n\nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said.\n\nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n\nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. GitHub's 2023 Octoverse report states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n\nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n\nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

    "summary": "SAN JOSE — The massive tech layoffs that have jolted the Bay Area job market have primarily affected non-tech employees of the companies that orchestrated the local job cuts, a new report released Tuesday states.\n\n\nThe new CBRE report — which determined that the Bay Area is the nation's top region for tech talent — offers a fresh look at the nature of the tech layoffs that have haunted the Bay Area economy for more than 18 months.\n\n\n'Even as the tech sector's resilience was tested in 2022, the (Bay Area) region continues to lead with the largest tech talent labor pool and highest number of tech roles of any U.S. market,' stated the new 'Scoring Tech Talent' report from CBRE, a commercial real estate firm.\n\n\nApple Park complex in Cupertino that is the headquarters of Apple, seen in the upper section of the image. The Steve Jobs Theater is in the lower right. \n\n\nThe CBRE report for the first time examined and compared wages in key tech regions. The Bay Area is the location for the nation's highest-paid tech workers.\n\n\nIn 2021, annual tech wages averaged $185,425 in the Bay Area, $172,009 in Seattle and $121,794 in Boston, CBRE determined.\n\n\nTucked away in the new report was an overall assessment of the nature of the tech industry layoffs that have occurred in the Bay Area, a bout of job cuts that began at the outset of 2022.\n \nPeople stand in front of a sign with the Meta Platforms logo on Hacker Way in Menlo Park. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group)\n\n\n'Many Bay Area tech employers slowed hiring and made staff reductions, but most layoffs are affecting non-tech roles like marketing, finance and recruiting,' said Chris Shepherd, an executive vice president in CBRE's tech and media practice.\n\n\nFrom January 2022 through mid-July 2023, a period of slightly more than 18 months, tech companies have revealed plans to chop more than 26,000 jobs in the Bay Area.\n \nDespite the massive nature of the job cuts, tech companies appear to be using scalpels rather than butcher knives to trim their workforces and reallocate employees.\n\n\n'Many companies continue to hold on to their engineering talent,' Shepherd said.\n\n\nPlus, signs have emerged that the Bay Area's ever-restless technology industry is taking the initial steps to harvest more promising fields.\n\n\n'We are seeing new start-up companies emerge, a potential sign that we are entering a new cycle,' Shepherd said. 'Recruiting and retaining tech talent remains a priority for many companies, in addition to creating an attractive office experience for employees.'\n\n\nTech companies are thought to be redeploying resources already, CBRE's report indicated.\n\n\n'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech,' said Colin Yasukochi, executive director of CBRE's tech insights center. 'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech.'",

    "summary": "New Report from The Technology Councils of North America highlights growing national tech workforce thanks to immigration-friendly national policy\n\nKITCHENER, ON, July 11, 2023 /CNW/ -- The Technology Councils of North America (  ) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN) today released \"Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since The Pandemic,\" a new report exploring globalization and migration of tech occupations in Canada. The findings highlight that between April 2022 and March 2023, 32,115 new workers came to Canada with the most migrating from India and Nigeria. This move is due largely in part to a more immigration-friendly national policy and a labor cost advantage. The report also highlighted the most attractive Canadian cities to top tech talent, with Mississauga, Ont., ranking first followed by Montreal, Que. and Waterloo, Ont.\n\nOntario boasts the largest number of tech workers within the country, but smaller provinces, like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, are experiencing the most rapid growth. Both reported the largest year-over-year growth in their respective tech workforces, at 16.3%. Windsor, Ontario has seen the highest growth in tech workers over the past year (28%), followed by Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and Timmins, Ontario. This shift is reflective of broader workforce trends, with largely remote tech workers moving away from major metropolitan areas toward more rural locations.\n\n\"Our goal at  is to serve as the collective voice of the regional tech hubs and tech associations we represent to help build the North American technology economy. This report is an important step in supporting this growth and helping our Canadian members better understand the state of the current workforce ecosystem,\" said Yvonne Pilon, Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, , and President & CEO of Windsor-based WEtech Alliance. \"Given the radical shortfall in tech workers to fill available jobs in recent years, it's imperative we understand migration movements to better serve our members, the innovation workforce, and the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nKey Findings\n\n*Migration findings from April 2022-March 2023\n\nCanada's Top Ranking Net Migration of Tech Workers by Country\n\nIndia (15,097 tech workers)\n\n(15,097 tech workers) Nigeria (1,808 tech workers)\n\n(1,808 tech workers) Brazil (1,675 tech workers)\n\n(1,675 tech workers) Ukraine (1,207 tech workers)\n\n(1,207 tech workers) Philippines (1,129 tech workers)\n\n(1,129 tech workers) Iran (1,046 tech workers)\n\n(1,046 tech workers) France (935 tech workers)\n\n(935 tech workers) UAE (744 tech workers)\n\nHong Kong SAR (715 tech workers)\n\nPakistan (588 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Largest In-Migration by City\n\nMississauga, Ontario (1,900 tech workers)\n\n(1,900 tech workers) Montreal, Quebec (959 tech workers)\n\n(959 tech workers) Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (633 tech workers)\n\n(633 tech workers) Windsor, Ontario, Canada (557 tech workers)\n\n(557 tech workers) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (525 tech workers)\n\n(525 tech workers) Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada (456 tech workers)\n\n, Canada (456 tech workers) Kitchener, Ontario, Canada (437 tech workers)\n\n(437 tech workers) London, Ontario, Canada (418 tech workers)\n\n(418 tech workers) Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (363 tech workers)\n\n(363 tech workers) Calgary, Alberta, Canada (331 tech workers)\n\nCanada's Tech Industry Workforce by Province and Territories, 1-Year Percent Growth\n\nSaskatchewan (16.3%)\n\n(16.3%) Newfoundland and Labrador (16.3%)\n\nand (16.3%) Manitoba (15.4%)\n\n(15.4%) Nova Scotia (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Alberta (14.3%)\n\n(14.3%) Ontario (13.7%)\n\n(13.7%) New Brunswick (12.9%)\n\n(12.9%) British Columbia (12.3%)\n\n(12.3%) Yukon (12.2%)\n\n(12.2%) Prince Edward Island (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Quebec (11.7%)\n\n(11.7%) Northwest Territories (9.4%)\n\n(9.4%) Nunavut (6.5%)\n\nOntario's Top 10 Global Regions of Tech Worker Net Migration (Gained Talent - Lost Talent)\n\nKarnataka, India (+797 net change)\n\n(+797 net change) Maharashtra, India (+688 net change)\n\n(+688 net change) Gujarat, India (+417 net change)\n\n(+417 net change) Telangana, India (+392 net change)\n\n(+392 net change) Tamil Nadu, India (+386 net change)\n\n(+386 net change) Ukraine (+353 net change)\n\n(+353 net change) Quebec, Canada (+309 net change)\n\n(+309 net change) Delhi, India (+290 net change)\n\n(+290 net change) Kerala, India (+246 net change)\n\n(+246 net change) Nigeria (+217 net change)\n\nWhile Canada has lost talent to the U.S. overall, net loss is not significant at only 1,672 workers. Considering the population of the U.S. compared to Canada and the total tech workforce of each, this demonstrates Canada's competitiveness to tech employment opportunities. Canada is gaining American talent from the Northeastern states, and still attracting talent from major U.S. cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. The average compensation for U.S. tech occupations per the report is $175,600 CAD ($133,500 USD), while the average compensation for the same tech occupations in Canada is $100,400 CAD ($73,897 USD).\n\n\"We are thrilled with the recent announcement by Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, as it paves the way for Canada to welcome workers with H1B visas into our tech ecosystem. This groundbreaking program is set to bring 10,000 highly skilled professionals to our country, fortifying our position as a leading destination for tech talent,\" said Chris Albinson, CEO and president at Communitech. \"In addition, the Toronto-Waterloo corridor, one of North America's largest and fastest growing tech hubs, already attracts talented individuals on a daily basis, and this new initiative will propel our ecosystem to even greater heights. Equally important, the valuable data provided in this study grants Canadian teams crucial insights into tech talent migration, empowering them to make informed hiring decisions, and better serve the broader technology ecosystem.\"\n\nCanada's tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from BDC and combined with the findings in this data report, signify the country might be giving its southern counterpart a run for its money. The large migration of tech workers also fills the need for skilled workers amid an ongoing global talent shortage and points to a hopeful and prosperous future for Canada's tech occupation workforce.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe report is based on data sourced by labor market data and includes data points from numerous sources collected, analyzed, and visualized by eIMPACT .\n\nFor purposes of this study, \"tech talent / occupations / workers\" is defined by a proxy custom group of NOC linked occupation skill codes including roles such as Software Developers, Network and Computer Systems Administrators, and Information Security Analysts. This group of tech workers is sometimes referred to as a tech occupation cluster and tech occupation profiles.\n\n \n\nThe Technology Councils of North America () represents approximately 60 IT and Technology trade organizations that, in turn, represent more than 22,000 technology-related companies in North America.  serves its members and the industry through its strong peer-to-peer network and its regional initiatives to raise the visibility and viability of the technology industry. This is accomplished by empowering regional technology organizations and serving as their collective voice in growing the North American technology economy.

    "summary": "Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox. This surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canadas expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canadas Tech Network (CTN). Of the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nations allure in the tech industry. Following India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canadas immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox. Khalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more. Mississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020. The report, titled Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic, sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canadas tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox. The migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023. Although the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. (ANI)",

Tech Hokies and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are set to tip at 5:00 p.m. ET on January 27th at Cassell Coliseum. Va. Tech will be strutting in after a win while Georgia Tech will be stumbling in from a defeat.\n\nLast Tuesday, the Hokies earned a 76-71 win over the Eagles. The victory made it back-to-back wins for Va. Tech.\n\nVa. Tech can attribute much of their success to Hunter Cattoor, who scored 17 points along with three steals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yellow Jackets came up short against the Panthers on Tuesday and fell 72-64. The loss unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Georgia Tech in their matchups with Pittsburgh: they've now lost four in a row.\n\nDespite their defeat, Georgia Tech saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays. Kyle Sturdivant, who scored 14 points, was perhaps the best of all. Another player making a difference was Kowacie Reeves Jr., who scored 15 points along with five rebounds.\n\nThe Hokies' victory bumped their record up to 12-7. As for the Yellow Jackets, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost seven of their last eight matches, which put a noticeable dent in their 9-10 record this season.\n\nLooking forward to Saturday, Va. Tech is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 8.5 points. For those looking to play the spread, keep Va. Tech's opponent in mind: they have a subpar 1-6 record against the spread vs Georgia Tech over their last seven matchups.\n\nVa. Tech came up short against Georgia Tech when the teams last played back in February of 2023, falling 77-70. Will Va. Tech have more luck at home instead of on the road?\n\n\n\nVa.

Regional restrictions may apply.)\n\nfuboTV (Try for free. Regional restrictions may apply.) Ticket Cost: $40.00\n\nWhat to Know\n\nWe've got another exciting ACC matchup on schedule as the Va. Tech Hokies and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are set to tip at 5:00 p.m. ET on January 27th at Cassell Coliseum. Va. Tech will be strutting in after a win while Georgia Tech will be stumbling in from a defeat.\n\nLast Tuesday, the Hokies earned a 76-71 win over the Eagles. The victory made it back-to-back wins for Va. Tech.\n\nVa. Tech can attribute much of their success to Hunter Cattoor, who scored 17 points along with three steals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yellow Jackets came up short against the Panthers on Tuesday and fell 72-64. The loss unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Georgia Tech in their matchups with Pittsburgh: they've now lost four in a row.\n\nDespite their defeat, Georgia Tech saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays. Kyle Sturdivant, who scored 14 points, was perhaps the best of all. Another player making a difference was Kowacie Reeves Jr., who scored 15 points along with five rebounds.\n\nThe Hokies' victory bumped their record up to 12-7. As for the Yellow Jackets, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost seven of their last eight matches, which put a noticeable dent in their 9-10 record this season.\n\nLooking forward to Saturday, Va. Tech is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 8.5 points. For those looking to play the spread, keep Va. Tech's opponent in mind: they have a subpar 1-6 record against the spread vs Georgia Tech over their last seven matchups.\n\nVa. Tech came up short against Georgia Tech when the teams last played back in February of 2023, falling 77-70. Will Va. Tech have more luck at home instead of on the road?\n\n\n\nVa. Tech is a big 8.5-point favorite against Georgia Tech, according to the latest college basketball odds.\n\nThe oddsmakers were right in line with the betting community on this one, as the game opened as a 8.5-point spread, and stayed right there.\n\nThe over/under is set at 146 points.\n\nSee college basketball picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model.

    "summary": "SAN JOSE — The massive tech layoffs that have jolted the Bay Area job market have primarily affected non-tech employees of the companies that have orchestrated the local job cuts, a new report released Tuesday states.\n\nThe new CBRE report — which determined that the Bay Area is the nation's top region for tech talent — offers a fresh look at the nature of the tech layoffs that have haunted the Bay Area economy for more than 18 months.\n\n'Even as the tech sector's resilience was tested in 2022, the (Bay Area) region continues to lead with the largest tech talent labor pool and highest number of tech roles of any U.S. market,' stated the new 'Scoring Tech Talent' report from CBRE, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nThe CBRE report for the first time examined and compared wages in key tech regions. The Bay Area is paying the highest wages for tech workers.\n\nIn 2021, annual tech wages averaged $185,425 in the Bay Area, $172,009 in Seattle and $121,794 in Boston, CBRE determined.\n\nTucked away in the new report was an overall assessment of the nature of the tech industry layoffs that have occurred in the Bay Area, a bout of job cuts that began at the outset of 2022.\n\n'Many Bay Area tech employers slowed hiring and made staff reductions, but most layoffs are affecting non-tech roles like marketing, finance and recruiting,' said Chris Shephard, an executive vice president in CBRE's tech and media practice.\n\nFrom January 2022 through mid-July 2023, a period of slightly more than 18 months, tech companies have revealed plans to chop more than 26,000 jobs in the Bay Area.\n\nDespite the massive nature of the job cuts, tech companies appear to be using scalpels rather than butcher knives to trim their workforces and reallocate employees.\n\n'Many companies continue to hold on to their engineering talent,' Shephard said.\n\nPlus, signs have emerged that the Bay Area's ever-restless technology industry is taking the initial steps to harvest more promising fields.\n\n'We are seeing new start-up companies emerge, a potential sign that we are entering a new cycle,' Shephard said. 'Recruiting and retaining tech talent remains a priority for many companies, in addition to creating an attractive office experience for employees.'\n\nTech companies are thought to be redeploying resources already, CBRE's report indicated.\n\n'Artificial intelligence has seen a surge in venture capital funding, a positive indicator for the future growth of tech,' said Colin Yasukochi, executive director of CBRE's tech insights center.

    "excerpt": "Wondering where to pursue or advance your technology career? Learn about the best and worst states for careers in technology.",
    "summary": "There's no place quite like San Francisco. With its dizzying hills, pastel Victorian houses and fog-shrouded bridges, the Californian metropolis makes for perfect postcards.\n\nBut beyond its old-world charm and chilly summers, the San Francisco Bay Area is famously known as the global center of tech innovation. Ask anyone who's taken a self-driving car through the streets of downtown: Nearly every billboard boasts software solutions, AI-powered platforms or, conversely, platforms that will tell you if something was created with an AI-powered platform.\n\nGiven San Francisco's reputation, California is usually the state that comes to mind when people think of technology career hubs. But if you're after a career in technology, you don't necessarily have to flee west. In fact, California doesn't even rank among the top three U.S. states for tech careers.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive deep into the best states for tech professionals. We'll also explore areas where tech employment is flatlining. Keep reading to discover the best and worst states for technology careers.\n\nCareers in Technology on the Rise\n\nNinety-two percent of jobs require digital skills. [3]\nNearly half of tech professionals worked remotely as of May 2022. [4]\nComputer and IT occupations are projected to grow much faster than all occupations nationwide. [5]\n\nTechnology is a fast-paced field, and tech jobs are expected to grow rapidly compared to the average projected growth rate for all U.S. occupations. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), [5] roughly 377,500 new technology jobs will open each year between 2022 and 2032. And with the proliferation of online information technology degrees and coding bootcamps, obtaining the skills needed to enter the tech industry is easier than ever.\n\nJobs in tech generally afford workers top-notch flexibility, as many of these positions can be completed from home—or anywhere with a stable internet connection. Plus, remote jobs give tech employees the flexibility to work while traveling the world (or staying put on the couch).\n\nMoreover, tech is a relatively lucrative career. The BLS reports that the mean national wage for computer and mathematical occupations is $108,130. [5] In some states, as we'll see below, mean annual salaries for tech workers are even higher.\n\nThe Best States for Tech Careers\n\nThe table below lists how each U.S. state ranks for tech careers based on a methodology that accounts for the number of tech businesses in the state, wages for tech jobs, tech employment and economic growth. We sourced data for this table from the U.S. Census Bureau, [6], [7] the BLS [1] and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. [8]\n\nTop-Ranking States for Tech Careers\n\nWashington, D.C.\nColorado\nWashington\nCalifornia\nVirginia\n\nWashington, D.C., ranked as the best place for pursuing a tech career. It's home to some of the highest-earning tech workers in the nation, with a mean annual salary of ​​$119,610. [1]\n\nWhile tech workers earn a higher mean salary in a few states, Washington, D.C., cultivates a highly favorable climate for tech workers. A little over 7% of the total workforce is employed in tech—more than any state in the country. [1] Additionally, Washington, D.C., exhibited strong GDP growth over the last five years. [8]\n\nIn Colorado, tech workers make an average of $116,620 per year. [1] The state's GDP expanded significantly in the last five years, and tech workers make up about 4.7% of the state's total workforce. [8]\n\nTech workers earn some of the highest annual mean salaries in Washington and California: $129,870 and $143,670, respectively. While California is certainly a tech epicenter, Washington outpaces the Golden State with its percentage of workers in tech. Six percent of Washington's employed population works in tech, while California's hovers at just under 4%. [1]\n\nIn Virginia, tech workers earn an annual average of $118,100. About 6.2% of the total workforce is employed by tech companies, [1] and the state GDP grew by 8% in the last five years. [8]\n\nWorst States for Tech Careers\n\nIndiana\nMontana\nNorth Dakota\nMississippi\nLouisiana\n\nIn Indiana, tech workers bring home a mean annual salary of $80,870 and make up only 2% of the state's total workforce. Tech workers in Montana and North Dakota earn average annual salaries of $83,300 and $76,900, respectively. In both states, just under 2% of the total workforce is employed in tech. [1]\n\nDespite their strong GDP growth, Mississippi and Louisiana are the two worst states for tech jobs in the United States. Workers in these states earn mean annual salaries of $75,840 and $78,720, respectively. In both Mississippi and Louisiana, only 1.2% of the total workforce is employed by the tech industry. [1]\n\nStates Where Tech Workers Earn the Most Money\n\nThe table below outlines the top 10 states where tech workers make the most money, accounting for both median hourly earnings and mean annual earnings.\n\nNationwide, tech workers earn a mean annual salary of $108,130. Average tech salaries in all of the 10 states listed below exceed the national mean. Tech workers in California are the highest earners, bringing home an average of $143,670 per year. The median hourly wage for tech workers in California is $61.87—much higher than the national median of $48.29 per hour. [1]\n\nDelaware tech workers are the 10th-highest earners in the nation. They bring in a mean annual wage of $109,040. Median hourly earnings in Delaware amount to $50.75. [1]\n\nAcross the other eight states, mean annual earnings range from $114,360 to $129,870. Median hourly wages range from $51.19 to $61.64. [1]\n\nStates With the Highest Rates of Female Employment in Tech\n\nThough the tech industry is predominantly male, some states outperform others in employing female-identifying workers. We sourced data for this section from the U.S. Census Bureau, [2] which limits its data reporting to male and female identities.\n\nNationwide, roughly 74.1% of tech employees identify as male, while only 25.9% identify as female. [2]\n\nThe following table lists the 10 states leading the nation in the employment of female-identifying tech workers. Alaska tops the charts, with 37% of the tech workforce identifying as female. [2]\n\nIn Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana and Kentucky, female tech workers make up around 29% of the total tech workforce. In Washington, D.C., the tech workforce is 31.6% female. In Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota and Hawaii, the percentage of female tech workers ranges between 32.5% and 35.5%. [2]\n\nFeatured Online Schools\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial credit and much more by clicking 'Visit Site'\n\nSources\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the best states for tech, Forbes Advisor compiled and analyzed a number of government datasets.\n\nFrom the Census Bureau's latest County Business Patterns data, [7] we used the number of business establishments that the CBP had classified as within the 'Information' industry (NAICS Code 15). We also used the total number of business establishments to determine the concentration of tech businesses in the overall economic landscape of each U.S. state.\n\nFor tech workforce metrics, we used the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2022 data to identify employment per 1,000 jobs in each state, along with median hourly wages and the percentage of the workforce employed by each sector. [1] We then compared these metrics between 'All Occupations' and 'Computer and Mathematical Occupations.'\n\nFinally, we referred to the Bureau of Economic Analysis for data on each state's overall GDP growth over the five years between 2018 and 2022 to give an indication of broader economic performance.

Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\n \n The report, titled ‘Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\n \n The migration data further revealed that the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\n \n \nAlso Read:\n \nCanada Express Entry: Nearly 10,000 immigrants invited in just two week.

Tech is heading back home. The Va. Tech Hokies and the Boston College Eagles will face off in an ACC battle at 9:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday at Cassell Coliseum. Coming in fresh off a win as the underdog, Va. Tech will stroll into this one as the favorite.\n After a disappointing 57 points in their last match, Va. Tech made sure to put some points up on the board against North Carolina State on Saturday. The Hokies came out on top against the Wolfpack by a score of 84-78.\n Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead Va. Tech to victory, but perhaps none more so than Hunter Cattoor, who scored 19 points. Lynn Kidd was another key contributor, scoring 14 points along with six rebounds.\n Meanwhile, the Eagles couldn't handle the Tar Heels on Saturday and fell 76-66. The defeat unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Boston College in their matchups with N. Carolina: they've now lost five in a row.\n Boston College's defeat came about despite a quality game from Quinten Post, who dropped a double-double on 19 points and ten rebounds. Less helpful for Boston College was Claudell Harris Jr.'s abysmal 0-5 three-point shooting.\n The Hokies' win ended a five-game drought on the road dating back to last season and puts them at 11-7. As for the Eagles, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost three of their last four games, which put a noticeable dent in their 11-7 record this season.\n Va. Tech came up short against Boston College in their previous meeting back in February of 2023, falling 82-76. Can Va. Tech avenge their defeat or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough.\nOdds\nVa.

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n \nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n \n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n \nAfter a year defined by \nmass layoffs\n among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n \nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the \nFAANG ecosystem\n) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n \nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but \neconomic volatility\n and the \nprevalence of tech endeavors\n in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n \n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n \nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in \noverall cost of living and layoffs\n that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n \nAccording to tech layoff tracker \nLayoffs.FYI\n, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, \nMeta\n, \nMicrosoft\n, \nAmazon\n, \nSalesforce\n and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n \nThis week, Google announced \nanother round of layoffs\n hitting engineering and hardware teams; \nAmazon laid off\n staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company \nDiscord cut\n 17% of its staff.\n \nLooking for the money\n \nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a \nReddit thread\n, \"I honestly care more about money and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n \nAccording to \nDice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report\n, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n \nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n \nA 2023 report from CBRE says \nnon-tech companies\n already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n \nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n \nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n \nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n \nTech job growth geographically\n \nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said. \n \n \nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n \nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. \nGitHub's 2023 Octoverse report\n states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n \nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n \nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

    "summary": "Innovators Under Fire: Tech Pioneers' Perception Shift\nDaniel Lozovsky\n·\n·\nFollow\n4 min read\n·\n·\n·\nJust now Just now\n--\nListen\nShare\nHave you ever thought about why celebrated tech leaders are now criticized? This change is due to new views on work-life balance and what society expects.\nImagine turning down a dream job in San Francisco to better your life. Today's tech minds value freedom over traditional success. They embrace remote work to balance life and work in new ways.\nThe battle for talent pushes us to accept remote work. This lets us find and keep creative people. Using new work models, we can keep leading as the world changes around us.\nKey Takeaways\nThe evolving dynamics of public perception influence the challenges faced by tech pioneers .\n. Shifts in work-life balance priorities highlight the importance of personal lifestyle optimization.\nRemote work models, like the Remote Affinity Ratio (RAR), offer new perspectives on success.\nEmbracing remote capabilities could redefine talent acquisition in the tech industry.\nSocietal expectations and the 'war for talent' impact technological innovation and public perception.\nThe Evolution of Public Perception of Tech Pioneers\nPeople have changed how they see tech creators. At first, they were seen as heroes.\nThe Rise of Tech Giants\nApple, Google, and Facebook made cool new tech. They started a digital age. Everyone liked them a lot. They were seen as the best innovators.\nFrom Heroes to Villains\nBut then, these companies got big. People started to worry. They questioned if these companies were good.\nNow, people think different about them. It shows we need to think about tech's big picture.\nHow we see these big tech companies is changing. This will affect the future of new ideas.\nMedia's Role in Shaping Opinions on Tech Innovators\nThe media tells us how to see tech leaders. They can be seen as heroes or as controversial figures. This affects our thoughts a lot.\nSensationalism and Clickbait\nMedia changes how we see technology and its creators. They make headlines to get our attention. This can trick readers. It focuses on drama over real facts.\nThis approach can twist the truth. It plays on our quick judgments of tech leaders. It makes it hard for us to understand them fully.\nMisrepresentation and Bias\nMedia often doesn't tell the whole story about tech people. They might only show good or bad sides. This creates a one-sided view.\nThis biases our views on technology. It can make us either love or hate tech leaders without seeing the full picture. Media stories shape these views, which can hide their real work.\nHow Political Climate Influences Public Perception of Technology\nThe way we see tech is influenced by where politics and technology meet. The politics of our time changes how we think about tech. Things like being safe online and big companies watching us are big talks in politics. These talks show us how we should use tech right.\nLeaders and laws help shape these talks and what we think. Laws about smart computers and changing genes show how politics can change our view. When leaders talk about the good and bad of tech, it changes how we trust tech.\nTechnology changes fast, making it hard for governments to keep up. This struggle shapes how we see new tech. Every law or rule adds to the story of politics and technology. Our tech future is closely linked to the political world.\nInnovators Under Fire: How Politics Skew Public Perception of Tech Pioneers\nPolitics really shape what we think about tech leaders today. Tech folks face more challenges because of political issues. These issues can make people view them in different ways. They also affect how new tech is seen and used.\nCase Studies of Divisive Figures\nSome tech people get a lot of attention because of politics. Take Mark Zuckerberg. He gets criticism because Facebook affects elections and privacy. Elon Musk, who works on electric cars and space, also gets caught in political talks. This is about the environment and job rules. Their stories show how politics can change how we see their work.\nImpact of Government Policies\nGovernments can either help or slow down tech progress. In Europe, GDPR changed how companies handle data. In the U.S., net neutrality talks show how laws affect tech. These rules are meant to protect us. But, they can also make it hard for tech leaders. They have to be very smart to deal with these rules.\nIt's important to understand how laws affect tech views. Knowing this helps us see the challenges tech leaders face. Politics and tech together shape the future. By looking at these stories and laws, we learn about overcoming tough times.\nChallenges Faced by Tech Innovators\nTech innovators face a tough world today. They deal with rules and unhappy people.\nAs tech grows fast, these problems get bigger. Rules can slow down new ideas. They make investors careful.\nRegulatory Hurdles\nRegulatory hurdles are big for tech companies. In Europe, there's GDPR. In the U.S., the FTC watches them.\nThese rules keep people safe. But they can slow down new tech. Companies try hard to follow rules and still be innovative.\nPublic Backlash\nPeople are more upset with tech now. They worry about how their data is used. Facebook and Uber have had big problems.\nTech companies need to be open and do right by people. It's tricky but important. They need to earn people's trust while still making new things.\nSource Links",

Tech is heading back home. The Va. Tech Hokies and the Boston College Eagles will face off in an ACC battle at 9:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday at Cassell Coliseum. Coming in fresh off a win as the underdog, Va. Tech will stroll into this one as the favorite.\n After a disappointing 57 points in their last match, Va. Tech made sure to put some points up on the board against North Carolina State on Saturday. The Hokies came out on top against the Wolfpack by a score of 84-78.\n Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead Va. Tech to victory, but perhaps none more so than Hunter Cattoor, who scored 19 points. Lynn Kidd was another key contributor, scoring 14 points along with six rebounds.\n Meanwhile, the Eagles couldn't handle the Tar Heels on Saturday and fell 76-66. The defeat unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Boston College in their matchups with N. Carolina: they've now lost five in a row.\n Boston College's defeat came about despite a quality game from Quinten Post, who dropped a double-double on 19 points and ten rebounds. Less helpful for Boston College was Claudell Harris Jr.'s abysmal 0-5 three-point shooting.\n The Hokies' win ended a five-game drought on the road dating back to last season and puts them at 11-7. As for the Eagles, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost three of their last four games, which put a noticeable dent in their 11-7 record this season.\n Va. Tech came up short against Boston College in their previous meeting back in February of 2023, falling 82-76. Can Va. Tech avenge their defeat or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough.\nOdds\nVa. Tech is a solid 5.5-point favorite against Boston College, according to the latest \ncollege basketball odds\n.\nThe oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Hokies as a 5-point favorite.\nThe over/under is set at 148.5 points.\nSee \ncollege basketball picks\n for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. \nGet picks now\n.\n\n\nSeries History\nVa.

A8: Global events, like trade policies or international conflicts, can significantly impact tech stocks, affecting supply chains, market access, and investor confidence.\n\nQ9: How do interest rates affect tech stocks?

    "summary": "Ottawa [Canada], August 30 (ANI): Over 15,000 Indian tech workers have moved to Canada in the span of just 12 months, from April 2022 to March 2023, indicating that the country has emerged as a global magnet for tech industry talent, according to Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nThis surge in migration positions India as the largest contributor to Canada's expanding tech workforce, as highlighted by a recent joint report from The Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) and Canada's Tech Network (CTN).\n \n\n\nOf the more than 32,000 tech professionals who sought greener pastures, 15,097 chose Canada as their new home, underscoring the nation's allure in the tech industry.\nFollowing India on the list of contributors was Nigeria, with 1,808 tech workers making their journey to Canada. Experts attribute this phenomenon to Canada's immigration-friendly policies and its competitive edge in terms of labour costs, as per Khalsa Vox.\n\n\nKhalsa Vox is an online digest that brings the latest in Punjab politics, history, culture, heritage and more.\nMississauga and Montreal are the two Canadian cities that stand out as the prime beneficiaries of this influx of global tech talent. Mississauga which boasts a robust community of nearly 1,000 IT firms and an impressive workforce of over 300,000 tech experts, has become a hub for tech innovation. Meanwhile, Montreal has witnessed a remarkable 31 per cent growth in its tech ecosystem between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\nThe report, titled ‘Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since the Pandemic', sheds light on the significance of this surge in tech migration. It posits that the substantial migration of tech workers fulfils the critical demand for skilled professionals, a need that has become even more pronounced amid the ongoing global talent scarcity. This influx of tech talent is seen as a promising indicator of a prosperous future for Canada's tech industry, according to Khalsa Vox.\nThe migration data further reveals intriguing details about the tech worker flow. Mississauga welcomed 1,900 tech professionals from across the world, while Montreal witnessed the arrival of 959 tech experts during the specified period from April 2022 to March 2023.\n\n\nAlthough the majority of the influx is attributed to India, Nigeria, and Brazil, the report also highlights the growing attraction of Canadian tech opportunities for American talent. Notably, Canada is drawing tech professionals from major US cities such as Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. (ANI)\nThis report is auto-generated from ANI news service.

Tech will be in front of their home fans on Monday, but a look at the spread shows they might need that home-court advantage. The Va. Tech Hokies and the Duke Blue Devils will face off in an ACC battle at 7:00 p.m. ET at Cassell Coliseum. Both teams come into the game bolstered by wins in their previous matches.\n Va. Tech has made a habit of sweeping their opponents off the court, having now won six games by 21 points or more this season. Everything went their way against the Yellow Jackets on Saturday as the Hokies made off with a 91-67 win. The victory was nothing new for Va. Tech as they're now sitting on three straight.\n Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead Va. Tech to victory, but perhaps none more so than Mylyjael Poteat, who scored 18 points along with six rebounds. As a matter of fact, that's the most points Poteat has scored all season. Lynn Kidd was another key contributor, scoring 18 points.\n Meanwhile, the Blue Devils skirted by the Tigers 72-71 on Saturday thanks to a clutch free throw from Tyrese Proctor with but a second left in the second quarter. The victory made it back-to-back wins for Duke.\n Duke's victory was a true team effort, with many players turning in solid performances. Perhaps the best among them was Jared McCain, who scored 21 points along with five rebounds and three steals.

As for the Blue Devils, they are on a roll lately: they've won ten of their last 11 matchups, which provided a nice bump to their 15-4 record this season.\n Things could have been worse for Va. Tech, but things could have been a whole lot better as they took a 81-65 loss to Duke in their previous matchup back in February of 2023. Will Va.

Tech Hokies and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are set to tip at 5:00 p.m. ET on January 27th at Cassell Coliseum. Va. Tech will be strutting in after a win while Georgia Tech will be stumbling in from a defeat.\n\nLast Tuesday, the Hokies earned a 76-71 win over the Eagles. The victory made it back-to-back wins for Va. Tech.\n\nVa. Tech can attribute much of their success to Hunter Cattoor, who scored 17 points along with three steals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yellow Jackets came up short against the Panthers on Tuesday and fell 72-64. The loss unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Georgia Tech in their matchups with Pittsburgh: they've now lost four in a row.\n\nDespite their defeat, Georgia Tech saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays. Kyle Sturdivant, who scored 14 points, was perhaps the best of all. Another player making a difference was Kowacie Reeves Jr., who scored 15 points along with five rebounds.\n\nThe Hokies' victory bumped their record up to 12-7. As for the Yellow Jackets, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost seven of their last eight matches, which put a noticeable dent in their 9-10 record this season.\n\nLooking forward to Saturday, Va. Tech is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 8.5 points. For those looking to play the spread, keep Va. Tech's opponent in mind: they have a subpar 1-6 record against the spread vs Georgia Tech over their last seven matchups.\n\nVa. Tech came up short against Georgia Tech when the teams last played back in February of 2023, falling 77-70. Will Va. Tech have more luck at home instead of on the road?\n\n\n\nVa. Tech is a big 8.5-point favorite against Georgia Tech, according to the latest college basketball odds.\n\nThe oddsmakers were right in line with the betting community on this one, as the game opened as a 8.5-point spread, and stayed right there.\n\nThe over/under is set at 146 points.\n\nSee college basketball picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model.

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n\nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n\nAfter a year defined by mass layoffs among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the FAANG ecosystem) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n\nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but economic volatility and the prevalence of tech endeavors in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n\nGet Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n\nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in overall cost of living and layoffs that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n\nAccording to tech layoff tracker Layoffs.FYI, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n\nThis week, Google announced another round of layoffs hitting engineering and hardware teams; Amazon laid off staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company Discord cut 17% of its staff.\n\nLooking for the money\n\nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a Reddit thread, \"I honestly care more about money and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n\nAccording to Dice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n\nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n\nA 2023 report from CBRE says non-tech companies already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n\nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n\nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n\nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n\nTech job growth geographically\n\nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said.\n\nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n\nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. GitHub's 2023 Octoverse report states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n\nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n\nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

Noonan and Thomas Noonan, the complex has seven greens, shaped bunkers and approaches, all built with golf architect Tom Fazio's firm at the helm and former players like Matt Kuchar, Roberto Castro, Kris Mikkelsen and Carlton Forrester and others advising. The East end of the property, named for alumnus David Dorman, is designed for work on every short-game situation imaginable. Routing has been designed into the entire property for a par-3 competition course, named for alumni Linda and Ray Helton.\n\nBeyond the clubhouse, named for alum Stewart Cink and his wife Lisa, which includes lockers, showers, a kitchen area, a washer and a dryer, a refrigerator, microwave, and large television screens everywhere, there is the business of technology.\n\nInside the Kuchar Teaching Center, which includes three hitting bays, one of which is can be set up specifically for putting work, players and coaches have the ability to study their shots on video and with devices that monitor club head speed, weight on front foot vs. back foot, on toes vs. heels, club angle, ball velocity, and more.\n\nHere's a look at more college golf practice facilities.\n\nPhotos: Noonan Golf Facility\n\nNoonan Golf Facility Georgia Tech's Noonan Golf Facility.

    "summary": "Who's Playing\nPittsburgh Panthers @ Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\nCurrent Records: Pittsburgh 11-7, Georgia Tech 9-9\nHow To Watch\nWhat to Know\n Georgia Tech and Pittsburgh are an even 5-5 against one another since March of 2017, but not for long. Both teams will face off in an ACC battle at 7:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday at McCamish Pavilion. Georgia Tech is out to stop a three-game streak of losses at home.\n On Saturday, the Yellow Jackets came up short against the Cavaliers and fell 75-66. Georgia Tech has struggled against Virginia recently, as their match on Saturday was their 11th consecutive lost matchup.\n Despite the loss, Georgia Tech had strong showings from Naithan George, who scored 15 points along with nine assists, and Baye Ndongo, who scored 15 points along with five rebounds.\n Even though Pittsburgh has not done well against Duke recently (they were 1-9 in their previous ten matchups), they didn't let the past get in their way on Saturday. The Panthers managed a 80-76 win over the Blue Devils.\n Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead Pittsburgh to victory, but perhaps none more so than Blake Hinson, who made all 7 shots he took from beyond the arc racking up 24 points and 0 assists. The team also got some help courtesy of Jaland Lowe, who scored 17 points along with six assists.\n The Yellow Jackets have traveled a rocky road recently, as they've lost six of their last seven contests, which put a noticeable dent in their 9-9 record this season. As for the Panthers, their win bumped their record up to 11-7.\nThis contest is one where the number of possessions is likely to be a big factor: Georgia Tech have been smashing the glass this season, having averaged 38.9 rebounds per game. However, it's not like Pittsburgh struggles in that department as they've been averaging 39.7 rebounds per game. Given these competing strengths, it'll be interesting to see how their clash plays out.\n Georgia Tech came up short against Pittsburgh when the teams last played back in March of 2023, falling 89-81. Will Georgia Tech have more luck at home instead of on the road?\n\n\nSeries History\nGeorgia Tech and Pittsburgh both have 5 wins in their last 10 games.\nMar 08, 2023 - Pittsburgh 89 vs. Georgia Tech 81\nFeb 21, 2023 - Pittsburgh 76 vs. Georgia Tech 68\nJan 14, 2023 - Pittsburgh 71 vs. Georgia Tech 60\nFeb 19, 2022 - Georgia Tech 68 vs. Pittsburgh 62\nFeb 14, 2021 - Georgia Tech 71 vs. Pittsburgh 65\nMar 04, 2020 - Georgia Tech 73 vs. Pittsburgh 57\nFeb 08, 2020 - Pittsburgh 73 vs. Georgia Tech 64\nFeb 20, 2019 - Georgia Tech 73 vs. Pittsburgh 65\nJan 13, 2018 - Georgia Tech 69 vs. Pittsburgh 54\nMar 07, 2017 - Pittsburgh 61 vs. Georgia Tech 59",

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n\nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n\nAfter a year defined by mass layoffs among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the FAANG ecosystem) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n\nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but economic volatility and the prevalence of tech endeavors in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n\nGet Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n\nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in overall cost of living and layoffs that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n\nAccording to tech layoff tracker Layoffs.FYI, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n\nThis week, Google announced another round of layoffs hitting engineering and hardware teams; Amazon laid off staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company Discord cut 17% of its staff.\n\nLooking for the money\n\nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a Reddit thread, \"I honestly care more about money and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n\nAccording to Dice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n\nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n\nA 2023 report from CBRE says non-tech companies already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n\nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n\nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n\nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n\nTech job growth geographically\n\nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said.\n\nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n\nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. GitHub's 2023 Octoverse report states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n\nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n\nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

Coming in fresh off a win as the underdog, Va. Tech will stroll into this one as the favorite.\n After a disappointing 57 points in their last match, Va. Tech made sure to put some points up on the board against North Carolina State on Saturday. The Hokies came out on top against the Wolfpack by a score of 84-78.\n Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead Va. Tech to victory, but perhaps none more so than Hunter Cattoor, who scored 19 points. Lynn Kidd was another key contributor, scoring 14 points along with six rebounds.\n Meanwhile, the Eagles couldn't handle the Tar Heels on Saturday and fell 76-66. The defeat unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Boston College in their matchups with N. Carolina: they've now lost five in a row.\n Boston College's defeat came about despite a quality game from Quinten Post, who dropped a double-double on 19 points and ten rebounds. Less helpful for Boston College was Claudell Harris Jr.'s abysmal 0-5 three-point shooting.\n The Hokies' win ended a five-game drought on the road dating back to last season and puts them at 11-7. As for the Eagles, they have not been sharp recently, as they've lost three of their last four games, which put a noticeable dent in their 11-7 record this season.\n Va.

    "summary": "NEW! \n \n \nLongtime readers will know that we are big proponents of motorcycle airbag equipment here at \nMotorcycle.com\n. Our own Troy Siahaan experienced the benefits of the technology first hand, after the airbag on his \nAlpinestars Tech-Air 5 vest deployed\n in a collision with a car. \n\n\n \n \nThat's a big reason we're intrigued by the new Tech-Air 7x just announced by Alpinestars at the Consumer Electronics Show. Designed for racers, the 7x replaces the previous Tech-Air RACE, with integration with Alpinestars' existing Tech-Air 3, 5, and 10 systems.\nWe hope to get our hands on one soon (though hopefully not for another crash test), but here's what Alpinestars has to say about it:\n\n\n \n \nThe New Generation of Autonomous Electronic Airbag Systems\n \n \nAlpinestars has redefined protection for motorcyclists ever since the company was established in 1963, and today sees the brand launching Tech-Air® 7x, the all-new, autonomous motorcycling airbag system.\nTech-Air® 7x is the latest addition to the Alpinestars Tech-Air® family, which includes the Tech-Air® 10, Tech-Air® 5, Tech-Air® 3, and Tech-Air® OFF-ROAD systems. Alpinestars continues to lead the way in active air-bag technology for riders and their passengers. The all-new Tech-Air® 7x is a definitive demonstration of Alpinestars' continued commitment to making the most versatile airbag technology products in the industry.\nThe Tech-Air®7x system was developed for Road Racing competitions, with full coverage protection focused on the upper body. (Full-Back, Full-Chest, Collar Bones, and Shoulders) The Tech-Air®7x system replaces the Tech-Air® RACE, with the latest innovations coming from the Alpinestars research and development team. This autonomous system complements the existing range Tech-Air® 10, Tech-Air® 5, and Tech-Air® 3 systems.\nLike the \nTech\n-Air® RACE, one of the key features of the Tech-Air® 7x is its integration (via attachment) to Alpinestars Tech-Air® compatible garments for increased practicality and comfort with select Alpinestars racing leather suits and jackets. Tech-Air® 7x is also compatible with garments as a stand-alone Tech-Air® vest (Similar to Tech-Air® 5) with a converter kit included in the package.\n\n\n \n \nThe Tech-Air® 7x supports dual deployments with the end user being able to replace the canisters for the first four deployments before sending it in for full service and airbag bladder replacement.\nA convenience feature of Tech-Air® 7x is the USB-C charging port located in the activation flap on the chest. It's easily accessible even when the system is integrated inside a suit or jacket.\nOver 20 years ago, Alpinestars began development on the original Tech-Air® system. When launched in the market in 2011, the Tech-Air® system was recognized as the world's first airbag providing full upper body protection with a completely independent electronic management system, in addition to having the versatility of the vest which could be easily zipped into a variety of Tech-Air® compatible jackets. In December 2019, Tech-Air® 5 was recognized by CES as one of the must-see innovative products in the Wearables Technology Marketplace.\n\n\n \n \n \nBecome a \n \nMotorcycle.com\n insider.

    "excerpt": "Technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for more predictable compensation and stability.",
    "summary": "So far this year, Google, Amazon and Discord are among technology companies to announce layoffs.\n\nTech companies including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce laid off 6% to 13% of their workforce in 2023, leading more technology workers to trade the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of engineering hiring firm Karat.\n\nAfter a year defined by mass layoffs among Silicon Valley giants, technology workers are trading the prospect of high-growth equity and household-name employment for something more stable.\n\nAccording to 2023 data from tech interviewing platform Karat, non-tech enterprise companies successfully hire nine out of every 10 candidates they extend offers to, whereas growth-focused big tech companies (such as those in and around the FAANG ecosystem) hire just two-thirds of those they extend offers to.\n\nThis gap has grown in recent years. In 2020, hypergrowth tech secured more candidates, but economic volatility and the prevalence of tech endeavors in a range of industries have flipped the script.\n\nGet Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.\n\n\"Just as there was a flight to safety for investors, there has been the same one for candidates,\" said Jeff Spector, president and co-founder of Karat. \"Candidates are trading off upside for safety.\"\n\nThis flight to safety makes sense given prolonged high interest rates, dramatic increases in overall cost of living and layoffs that have — in a sense — punctured the vision of tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle as a place where tech talent can not only get their start but also grow in their career over the long-term without job hopping. \"The veil of invincibility has been pierced,\" Spector said.\n\nAccording to tech layoff tracker Layoffs.FYI, 584 tech companies laid off people in the first quarter of 2023. That number decreased over the course of the year, but it was much higher than in 2022, and the wound remains open. Tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and more laid off 6% to 13% of their company. In some cases, like that of X (formerly Twitter), half of the company lost employment.\n\nThis week, Google announced another round of layoffs hitting engineering and hardware teams; Amazon laid off staffers in its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios businesses; and social media company Discord cut 17% of its staff.\n\nLooking for the money\n\nIt's more than the numbers that feed the notion of disillusionment. One FAANG employee wrote on a Reddit thread, \"I honestly care more about money and promotion to the next level than about the work I'm currently doing. [...] I feel like changing companies is a better path to getting what I want rather than aiming for a promotion that may or may not happen.\"\n\nAccording to Dice's 2023 Tech Sentiment Report, 60% of tech workers in general are interested in leaving their jobs in 2024, which is up from 52% the year prior. This poses a major competitive opportunity for non-tech enterprises to attract tech talent.\n\nNon-tech enterprises are inviting talent with the promise of stable employment that prioritizes cash over equity that may not retain its value in the near term. Plus, they're not pigeonholed to tech hubs, enabling workers to live in more affordable cities and reduce commute times.\n\nA 2023 report from CBRE says non-tech companies already secure about 60% of tech talent, and that they haven't been part of a major layoff since 2022 (while tech companies account for nearly a third of the 700,000 global workforce layoffs by U.S. employers).\n\nAccording to Art Zeile, CEO of tech careers marketplace Dice, tech workers are most in demand in the aerospace, consulting, health care, financial services and education industries. Zeile says it's in spaces like these — non-tech enterprises with major tech branches — that tech workers can find better work-life balance and more stability than the tech leaders can provide.\n\nDespite the ongoing shift away from big tech, there are a couple of features that high-growth companies tend to provide that non-tech enterprises historically lag in: remote work flexibility and tech athleticism (or the culture of enabling creative tinkering and innovation). Despite the benefit of stability in the current economic climate, non-tech enterprises must still adapt to retain long-term interest given what top tech talent is used to.\n\nSpector says there are benefits to less innovation-focused side quests, namely that tech workers get to see more projects come to life. \"There are a lot of moonshot projects, a lot of experimental projects,\" Spector said about big tech organizations. In corporate America outside of big tech, he said, \"There is more of a dedication to making sure that the project gets fulfilled.\"\n\nTech job growth geographically\n\nUltimately, Zeile says recent layoffs have induced a jarring disruption in two decades of growth in big tech. As a result, \"the idea of stability is much more part of the conversation today,\" he said.\n\nIn his work in the tech hiring space, Spector has noticed that big tech is moving towards fulfilling more international contracts in places like India, with enterprises moving towards domestic full-time talent. This, he says, is a bit of a role reversal based on what we've historically seen in these two worlds. \"Everybody's starting to move into everybody else's space,\" Spector said, adding that the tech talent market will continue to get more competitive as geographical wage gaps begin to close.\n\nWith artificial intelligence increasingly important in job roles of all kinds — technology especially — Zeile says we're seeing more candidates moving in the direction of making sure they have the right skills to compete in current and future job markets. GitHub's 2023 Octoverse report states that 92% of all developers on the platform are using or experimenting with AI coding tools. That's just one example of the technology's infiltration into the minds of tech professionals.\n\nAI or not, hiring trends show that tech workers are reshaping what it means to be successful as a tech professional, casting aside earlier delineations of working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as the extent of what it means to thrive in the space.\n\nBut, Spector said, \"Memories are short.\" He can't say for sure whether this trend will last, but at the moment, many tech workers have an opportunity to secure greater stability while still doing what they do best.",

    "summary": "Orlando's tech workforce consists of workers employed in tech occupations and those working for tech companies.\nAs Orlando's economy evolves, growth in tech employment emerges as an area of opportunity.\nThe latest data highlights the region's emergence as a tech hub and underscores the need to ensure this growth translates into broad-based prosperity for all.\nOFFER ENDS SOON\nGet Over 50% Off Your Annual Membership\nACCESS AWARD-WINNING INSIGHTS & INTELLIGENCE\nSubscribe Now\nOrlando tech employment hits 74,000\nTech employment in Orlando reached 74,000 in 2023 — 2,000 more than in 2022 and 9,500 more than five years ago. Tech employment in the region expanded by 15% between 2018-2023, growing at a faster rate than total employment in the region, and is projected to surpass 76,000 in 2024.\nCompTIA's annual State of the Tech Workforce this year highlights Orlando as one of the fastest-growing regions for tech employment in the country.\nFlorida's fastest-growing tech center\nOrlando's tech workforce consists of workers employed in tech occupations and those working for tech companies.\nIn 2023, the number of people working for tech companies in Orlando (46,896) marginally exceeded the number working in tech occupations (45,641). Software was the dominant activity, with more than half (51.4%) of employees in Orlando's tech industry and the largest share of workers in tech occupations (35.6%).\nOrlando's tech employment grew by 2.8% in 2023, the second-highest rate among the 30 most populous regions in the country after Dallas. Orlando's growth was higher than tech favorite Austin (2.4%), Florida peers Miami (2.3%) and Tampa (1.5%), and more than twice the national rate of 1.2%.\nUnrealized opportunity\nThe latest data (2022) suggests the median salary for workers in tech occupations in Orlando was more than double the median wage across all occupations in the region.\nMeanwhile, Orlando's tech workforce doesn't reflect the region's racial and gender diversity. Just 28% of tech jobs are held by women, and just 16% and 11% are held by Hispanic and Black workers, respectively.\nHowever, when considered alongside tech's wage premium, the disparity represents an opportunity to move the needle on advancing broad-based prosperity. Growing tech employment among groups for whom Orlando's recent growth has proven inequitable must be a regional priority.\nA mandate for action — but also progress\nRegions always can do more to grow and nurture tech employment. In Orlando, where growth in tech occupations can be expected to occur organically alongside the region's expanding business base and ongoing technology adoption, the immediate opportunity is to grow and scale tech firms.\nThe foundation for progress in this area already is being laid. Plug and Play, the world's premier startup accelerator and most-active venture capital investment firm, entered the Orlando market in 2024 with two locations: one near the University of Central Florida and one at Osceola County's NeoCity. This represents a major step forward in growing Orlando's start-up ecosystem and to Orlando becoming America's next great tech hub.\nNeil Hamilton is vice president of market intelligence for the Orlando Economic Partnership, where he manages the organization's research activities.

    "excerpt": "As the tech industry continues to grow, so too do the job opportunities outside major hubs like Silicon Valley, Seattle, and New York City.",
    "summary": "Credit: Gerald Bernard/Shutterstock\n\nWorking in tech no longer means having to live in one of a handful of increasingly unaffordable cities, like New York City, Seattle, Chicago, and San Francisco. Instead, as jobs involving artificial intelligence and product security, among other areas, continue to grow, cities that weren't previously considered tech hubs now offer opportunities for both tech-related employment and affordable living. Here are a few examples, compiled using data from job market reports and cities, as well as input from tech recruiters and hiring managers.\n\nBentonville, Arkansas\n\nPerhaps best known for being Walmart's home city, Bentonville has been on the rise as a tech center for the last seven or eight years, according to Eóin O'Toole, a tech recruiter and managing partner at Riviera Partners. In addition to the big-box store giant, O'Toole says that there's a \"surging ecosystem both directly and indirectly related to Walmart,\" as well as other major employers, like JB Hunt and Tyson Foods. Not only do these companies have their own tech staff, but their industries are in the midst of technical transformation, which O'Toole says makes them \"prized client[s] for many leading-edge technology startups.\"\n\nAlong the same lines, Bentonville has also been attracting other tech businesses and talent. \"With the support of a very forward-looking local Northwest Arkansas council, you see the emergence of tech companies in fields like drones—think last-mile delivery—EVs, leading supply chain and consumer packaged goods logistics technology companies, and fintech, to name a few,\" says O'Toole. Plus, housing in Bentonville is 20% cheaper than the U.S. average.\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nTech recruiters and job reports frequently list Dallas and/or Austin in their picks for best emerging tech cities, but often included the caveat that Dallas has a lower cost of living. According to Kristen Fowler, an expert in recruiting trends within the tech industry, and the vice president and practice lead at Clarke Caniff Strategic Search, both cities have become tech hubs in the last 10 years, especially since the start of the pandemic. \"Given that Dallas is home to several major retailers—like Chewy, Neiman Marcus, and 7-11—as well as large tech companies like AT&T and Texas Instruments, and banking organizations like Capital One, talent is plentiful.,\" she explains.\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nAccording to Richard Heaton, a hiring manager of Cartisian Technical Recruitment, Detroit's tech sector began its current period of growth in 2010, picked up steam around 2014, and shows no signs of slowing down. During this time, General Motors \"has been putting major capital into tech and innovation,\" Heaton says, while Quicken Loans—one of the largest online mortgage lenders in the U.S.—continues to be one of the city's top employers, he adds. Additionally, Ford's Michigan Central \"innovation district\"—which the company describes as \"a hub in Detroit dedicated to advancing new tech, ideas, and programs\"—is slated to open later this year. Throw in the city's rapidly growing startup scene, and consistently being named as one of the cheapest cities in the country to buy a house, and it's not hard to see why Detroit is attracting top tech talent.\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nWith a mix of well-established tech employers and dynamic startups, Tampa has been increasingly recognized for its burgeoning tech scene—particularly since 2018, says Allan McNabb, vice president of Image Building Media, an internet marketing company based in the Florida city. \"Key players like Jabil and Tech Data, along with a surge in fintech and cybersecurity firms, have created a diverse tech landscape,\" he says. According to a 2023 report on tech talent by CBRE, a firm specializing in in commercial real estate services and investments, between 2016 and 2021, Tampa saw a 35% increase in residents in their 20s with a college degree: The highest of any city in North America.\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nSince the late 2000s, Pittsburgh has been quietly transforming into a tech powerhouse, says Kraig Kleeman, founder and CEO of The New Workforce. Google, Uber, Apple, IBM, and Facebook have offices in the Steel City, and being the home of Carnegie Mellon University means there's always a steady stream of new tech talent coming to the area. \"Pittsburgh's focus on artificial intelligence and robotics has made it a tech innovation hub,\" says Kleeman. Interestingly, according to the report from CBRE, Pittsburgh is the most racially and ethnically diverse market for women with a tech degree in the United States—though one of the least-diverse for men.\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\nHome to companies including Delta, Home Depot, Workday, BlackRock, Nordstrom, and Carvana, Atlanta has emerged as one of the largest markets for tech jobs in the country. But beyond the big names, the city also has a vibrant startup scene—particularly across the healthcare and logistics tech industries, says Maria Opre, a cybersecurity expert and senior analyst at EarthWeb. \"Through strategic collaborations between companies like Microsoft and Georgia Tech, Atlanta fosters partnerships and skills development,\" says Opre. \"While housing remains affordable compared to bigger hubs, salaries are competitive for a city of its size. There's also Atlanta Tech Village, a collaborative mentorship and working space for tech innovation, which Kleeman says has made an impact in the city by \"nurturing startups and providing a platform for entrepreneurs to thrive.\"\n\nAccording to a recent report from LinkedIn, there's been significant growth in tech jobs at non-tech companies: A trend set to continue as artificial intelligence and automation become increasingly common across industries. The bottom line is that you don't have to drop a large chunk of your salary on rent or a mortgage payment in order to live somewhere with a thriving tech scene. And if you already live in an established tech hub like San Francisco, but might want to broaden your job search, don't be afraid to do so.",

Tech Bulldogs and the FIU Panthers are set to tip at 3:00 p.m. ET on February 17th at Thomas Assembly Center. La. Tech's defense has only allowed 63.4 points per game this season, so the Panthers' offense will have their work cut out for them.\n Last Thursday, the Bulldogs were able to grind out a solid victory over the Gamecocks, taking the game 63-58.\n Terri Miller Jr. was the offensive standout of the match as he scored 17 points along with two steals.\n Meanwhile, it's hard to win when your three-point shooting is a whole 28.1% worse than the opposition, a fact FIU found out the hard way on Thursday. They fell 70-56 to the Bearkats. FIU has now taken an 'L' in back-to-back games.\n The Bulldogs have been performing well recently as they've won seven of their last nine contests, which provided a nice bump to their 17-8 record this season. As for the Panthers, their loss was their seventh straight on the road, which dropped their record down to 8-17.\n Saturday's contest is shaping up to be a scrappy match: La. Tech have been smashing the glass this season, having averaged 38.8 rebounds per game. It's a different story for FIU, though, as they've been averaging only 32.4 rebounds per game. Given La. Tech's sizable advantage in that area, the Panthers will need to find a way to close that gap.\n Everything came up roses for La. Tech against the Panthers in their previous meeting on February 1st as the squad secured a 93-53 win. With La. Tech ahead 59-26 at the half, the matchup was all but over already.\nOdds\nLa. Tech is a big 14-point favorite against FIU, according to the latest \ncollege basketball odds\n.\nThe oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Bulldogs as a 14.5-point favorite.\nThe over/under is 141.5 points.\nSee \ncollege basketball picks\n for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. \nGet picks now\n.\n\n\nSeries History\nLa.

They and the SE Missouri State Redhawks will face off in an Ohio Valley battle at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday at Show Me Center. Given that the pair suffered a loss in their last game, they both have a little extra motivation heading into this match.\n On Saturday, the Golden Eagles came up short against the Eagles and fell 67-60. The defeat unfortunately continues a disappointing trend for Tennessee Tech in their matchups with the Eagles: they've now lost three in a row.\n Meanwhile, SE Missouri State's recent rough patch got a bit rougher on Saturday after their fourth straight loss. They suffered a painful 76-55 loss at the hands of the Leathernecks. SE Missouri State found out winning isn't easy when your shooting is a whole 16.4% worse than the opposition.\n The Golden Eagles have been struggling recently as they've lost nine of their last 11 matchups, which put a noticeable dent in their 7-16 record this season. As for the Redhawks, their loss dropped their record down to an identical 7-16.\n Tennessee Tech beat the Redhawks 70-59 in their previous meeting back in January. The rematch might be a little tougher for Tennessee Tech since the squad won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.\n\n\nSeries History\nTennessee Tech has won 6 out of their last 10 games against SE Missouri State.\nJan 13, 2024 - Tennessee Tech 70 vs. SE Missouri State 59\nMar 04, 2023 - SE Missouri State 89 vs. Tennessee Tech 82\nFeb 04, 2023 - Tennessee Tech 82 vs. SE Missouri State 80\nJan 21, 2023 - SE Missouri State 84 vs. Tennessee Tech 77\nFeb 17, 2022 - Tennessee Tech 98 vs. SE Missouri State 94\nFeb 04, 2021 - SE Missouri State 68 vs. Tennessee Tech 64\nDec 30, 2020 - Tennessee Tech 72 vs. SE Missouri State 63\nFeb 22, 2020 - Tennessee Tech 71 vs. SE Missouri State 62\nFeb 08, 2020 - Tennessee Tech 62 vs. SE Missouri State 60\nFeb 07, 2019 - SE Missouri State 71 vs. Tennessee Tech 66",

    "summary": "Innovators Under Fire: Tech Pioneers' Perception Shift\nDaniel Lozovsky\n·\n·\nFollow\n4 min read\n·\n·\n·\nJust now Just now\n--\nListen\nShare\nHave you ever thought about why celebrated tech leaders are now criticized? This change is due to new views on work-life balance and what society expects.\nImagine turning down a dream job in San Francisco to better your life. Today's tech minds value freedom over traditional success. They embrace remote work to balance life and work in new ways.\nThe battle for talent pushes us to accept remote work. This lets us find and keep creative people. Using new work models, we can keep leading as the world changes around us.\nKey Takeaways\nThe evolving dynamics of public perception influence the challenges faced by tech pioneers .\n. Shifts in work-life balance priorities highlight the importance of personal lifestyle optimization.\nRemote work models, like the Remote Affinity Ratio (RAR), offer new perspectives on success.\nEmbracing remote capabilities could redefine talent acquisition in the tech industry.\nSocietal expectations and the 'war for talent' impact technological innovation and public perception.\nThe Evolution of Public Perception of Tech Pioneers\nPeople have changed how they see tech creators. At first, they were seen as heroes.\nThe Rise of Tech Giants\nApple, Google, and Facebook made cool new tech. They started a digital age. Everyone liked them a lot. They were seen as the best innovators.\nFrom Heroes to Villains\nBut then, these companies got big. People started to worry. They questioned if these companies were good.\nNow, people think different about them. It shows we need to think about tech's big picture.\nHow we see these big tech companies is changing. This will affect the future of new ideas.\nMedia's Role in Shaping Opinions on Tech Innovators\nThe media tells us how to see tech leaders. They can be seen as heroes or as controversial figures. This affects our thoughts a lot.\nSensationalism and Clickbait\nMedia changes how we see technology and its creators. They make headlines to get our attention. This can trick readers. It focuses on drama over real facts.\nThis approach can twist the truth. It plays on our quick judgments of tech leaders. It makes it hard for us to understand them fully.\nMisrepresentation and Bias\nMedia often doesn't tell the whole story about tech people. They might only show good or bad sides. This creates a one-sided view.\nThis biases our views on technology. It can make us either love or hate tech leaders without seeing the full picture. Media stories shape these views, which can hide their real work.\nHow Political Climate Influences Public Perception of Technology\nThe way we see tech is influenced by where politics and technology meet. The politics of our time changes how we think about tech. Things like being safe online and big companies watching us are big talks in politics. These talks show us how we should use tech right.\nLeaders and laws help shape these talks and what we think. Laws about smart computers and changing genes show how politics can change our view. When leaders talk about the good and bad of tech, it changes how we trust tech.\nTechnology changes fast, making it hard for governments to keep up. This struggle shapes how we see new tech. Every law or rule adds to the story of politics and technology. Our tech future is closely linked to the political world.\nInnovators Under Fire: How Politics Skew Public Perception of Tech Pioneers\nPolitics really shape what we think about tech leaders today. Tech folks face more challenges because of political issues. These issues can make people view them in different ways. They also affect how new tech is seen and used.\nCase Studies of Divisive Figures\nSome tech people get a lot of attention because of politics. Take Mark Zuckerberg. He gets criticism because Facebook affects elections and privacy. Elon Musk, who works on electric cars and space, also gets caught in political talks. This is about the environment and job rules. Their stories show how politics can change how we see their work.\nImpact of Government Policies\nGovernments can either help or slow down tech progress. In Europe, GDPR changed how companies handle data. In the U.S., net neutrality talks show how laws affect tech. These rules are meant to protect us. But, they can also make it hard for tech leaders. They have to be very smart to deal with these rules.\nIt's important to understand how laws affect tech views. Knowing this helps us see the challenges tech leaders face. Politics and tech together shape the future. By looking at these stories and laws, we learn about overcoming tough times.\nChallenges Faced by Tech Innovators\nTech innovators face a tough world today. They deal with rules and unhappy people.\nAs tech grows fast, these problems get bigger. Rules can slow down new ideas. They make investors careful.\nRegulatory Hurdles\nRegulatory hurdles are big for tech companies. In Europe, there's GDPR. In the U.S., the FTC watches them.\nThese rules keep people safe. But they can slow down new tech. Companies try hard to follow rules and still be innovative.\nPublic Backlash\nPeople are more upset with tech now. They worry about how their data is used. Facebook and Uber have had big problems.\nTech companies need to be open and do right by people. It's tricky but important. They need to earn people's trust while still making new things.\nSource Links",

    "summary": "Employer tech job posting volumes return to level last seen June 2023\nDOWNERS GROVE, Ill., June 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Employers' search for technology workers, from tech support staff to artificial intelligence (AI) specialists, accelerated in May, analysis by CompTIA, the nonprofit association for the information technology (IT) industry and workforce, reveals.\nTechnology companies added staff in May, though at a slower pace than recent months, CompTIA's analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) #JobsReport data reveals. The tech sector added 2,181 jobs last month, increasing employment to nearly 5.6 million workers. 1\nNew job postings for tech occupations reached 209,000 in May, an increase of nearly 27,000 from April and the highest total since June 2023, according to CompTIA's \"Tech Jobs Report.\" In total there were almost 427,000 active tech job postings last month. 2 The steady ascent of job postings for AI occupations or positions requiring AI skills continued, totaling more than 26,000 and accounting for 12% of all tech openings.\nThe unemployment rate for tech occupations dropped to 2.5%, well below the national rate of 4%. Technology occupations throughout the economy declined by 42,000, less than 1% of the total base of tech occupation employment of almost 6.4 million. 3\n\"The jump in tech job postings is an encouraging indicator more employers are coming off the sidelines,\" said Tim Herbert, chief research officer, CompTIA. \"It may reflect pent up demand for the tech talent companies will need to support digital growth initiatives.\"\nSeveral tech occupation categories saw double-digit increases in job postings in May, including data scientists (+24%), database administrators (18%), software developers (+17%), web developers (15%), network architects (12%) and tech support specialists (+10%).\nThree states saw tech job postings grow by more than 2,000 for the month – Texas (+2,978), California (+2,804) and Illinois (+2,062). Increases of more than 1,000 job postings occurred in four other states (Georgia, New York, Michigan and Florida).\nA number of metro markets experienced impressive increases in tech job postings, including Lansing (37%), Indianapolis (35%), Providence (30%), Chicago (29%), and San Antonio (28%), Washington has the highest volume of job postings (13,710) while New York City saw the biggest month over month increase in job posting volume (+1,793, to 12,023).\nCompTIA's new report also shows that 45% of all active tech job postings in May did not specify that candidates have a four-year degree, signaling that employers are widening their search for tech talent. Some essential tech positions had even higher percentages, such as network support specialists (86%), IT support specialists (72%), network and systems administrators (54%) and programmers (50%).\nThe \"CompTIA Tech Jobs Report\" is available at https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report.\nAbout CompTIA\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is the world's leading information technology (IT) certification and training body. CompTIA is a mission-driven organization committed to unlocking the potential of every student, career changer or professional seeking to begin or advance in a technology career. Millions of current and aspiring technology workers around the world rely on CompTIA for the training, education and professional certifications that give them the confidence and skills to work in tech. https://www.comptia.org/\n1 Labor market data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and employer job postings from Lightcast may be subject to backward revisions.\n2 Active job postings include open postings carried over from previous months and new postings added by employers.\n3 Monthly occupation level data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tends to experience higher levels of variance and volatility.",

    "summary": "Orlando's tech workforce consists of workers employed in tech occupations and those working for tech companies.\nAs Orlando's economy evolves, growth in tech employment emerges as an area of opportunity.\nThe latest data highlights the region's emergence as a tech hub and underscores the need to ensure this growth translates into broad-based prosperity for all.\nOFFER ENDS SOON\nGet Over 50% Off Your Annual Membership\nACCESS AWARD-WINNING INSIGHTS & INTELLIGENCE\nSubscribe Now\nOrlando tech employment hits 74,000\nTech employment in Orlando reached 74,000 in 2023 — 2,000 more than in 2022 and 9,500 more than five years ago. Tech employment in the region expanded by 15% between 2018-2023, growing at a faster rate than total employment in the region, and is projected to surpass 76,000 in 2024.\nCompTIA's annual State of the Tech Workforce this year highlights Orlando as one of the fastest-growing regions for tech employment in the country.\nFlorida's fastest-growing tech center\nOrlando's tech workforce consists of workers employed in tech occupations and those working for tech companies.\nIn 2023, the number of people working for tech companies in Orlando (46,896) marginally exceeded the number working in tech occupations (45,641). Software was the dominant activity, with more than half (51.4%) of employees in Orlando's tech industry and the largest share of workers in tech occupations (35.6%).\nOrlando's tech employment grew by 2.8% in 2023, the second-highest rate among the 30 most populous regions in the country after Dallas. Orlando's growth was higher than tech favorite Austin (2.4%), Florida peers Miami (2.3%) and Tampa (1.5%), and more than twice the national rate of 1.2%.\nUnrealized opportunity\nThe latest data (2022) suggests the median salary for workers in tech occupations in Orlando was more than double the median wage across all occupations in the region.\nMeanwhile, Orlando's tech workforce doesn't reflect the region's racial and gender diversity. Just 28% of tech jobs are held by women, and just 16% and 11% are held by Hispanic and Black workers, respectively.\nHowever, when considered alongside tech's wage premium, the disparity represents an opportunity to move the needle on advancing broad-based prosperity. Growing tech employment among groups for whom Orlando's recent growth has proven inequitable must be a regional priority.\nA mandate for action — but also progress\nRegions always can do more to grow and nurture tech employment. In Orlando, where growth in tech occupations can be expected to occur organically alongside the region's expanding business base and ongoing technology adoption, the immediate opportunity is to grow and scale tech firms.\nThe foundation for progress in this area already is being laid. Plug and Play, the world's premier startup accelerator and most-active venture capital investment firm, entered the Orlando market in 2024 with two locations: one near the University of Central Florida and one at Osceola County's NeoCity.

    "summary": "The tech industry is booming, and with it, the demand for authentic reviews on tech products has surged. Many consumers rely on detailed reviews to make informed purchasing decisions. If you love tech and have a knack for writing, there are numerous ways to monetize your reviews. Here are ten clever ways to earn money by writing reviews on tech products.\nStart a Tech Review Blog One of the most straightforward ways to earn money from tech reviews is by starting your own blog. Create a website where you can post detailed reviews of the latest gadgets, software, and tech accessories. Use search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to attract traffic to your blog. Monetize it through advertisements, sponsored posts, and affiliate marketing.\nJoin Affiliate Programs Affiliate marketing is a popular method to earn money by promoting tech products. Sign up for affiliate programs with companies like Amazon, Best Buy, or tech-specific retailers. Write reviews and include affiliate links to the products. When readers click on these links and make a purchase, you earn a commission. This can be particularly lucrative if your reviews attract a large audience.\nWrite for Tech Websites and Magazines Many tech websites and magazines are willing to pay for high-quality reviews. Pitch your ideas to editors of well-known tech publications. Writing for established sites not only provides an income but also helps build your reputation as a credible reviewer. Look for opportunities with websites like TechRadar, CNET, and Wired.\nCreate a YouTube Channel Video content is incredibly popular, and YouTube is a great platform to share tech reviews. Start a YouTube channel where you post video reviews of the latest tech products. Monetize your channel through ads, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing. Engaging video content can attract a large following, leading to substantial earnings.\nUse Social Media Platforms Social media is a powerful tool for reaching a wide audience. Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook allow you to share quick reviews and engage with followers. Use these platforms to drive traffic to your blog or YouTube channel. Brands often pay influencers to review their products, providing another income stream.\nParticipate in Review Programs Many tech companies have review programs where they send products to reviewers for free. While these programs often don't pay directly, they provide you with the latest tech gadgets to review. You can then monetize your reviews through your blog, YouTube channel, or social media platforms. Programs like Amazon Vine and Best Buy's Tech Insider Network are good places to start.\nFreelance Writing Freelance writing offers flexibility and the potential for a steady income. Platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr have numerous opportunities for tech review writers. You can find gigs writing reviews for blogs, websites, and even product descriptions for e-commerce sites. Set competitive rates and build a portfolio to attract more clients.\nWrite E-books and Guides If you have extensive knowledge about tech products, consider writing e-books or guides. You can sell these on platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing or your own website. E-books that provide in-depth reviews and buying guides for specific types of tech products can attract readers and generate passive income over time.\nHost Webinars and Workshops Sharing your expertise through webinars and workshops can be highly profitable. Offer sessions where you review and compare tech products, providing valuable insights to attendees. Charge a fee for access to these events or offer premium content to paying members. This method not only generates income but also establishes you as an authority in the tech review space.\nJoin Review Websites Some websites pay users to write reviews. Platforms like G2 Crowd, Trustpilot, and Influenster offer incentives for detailed and honest reviews. While these sites may not always focus exclusively on tech products, they often have opportunities to review software, gadgets, and other tech-related items. This can be a good way to earn extra money while building your review portfolio.\nConclusion Earning money by writing reviews on tech products is a viable option for tech enthusiasts and skilled writers. Whether you choose to start a blog, join affiliate programs, create a YouTube channel, or write for established tech websites, there are numerous ways to monetize your passion for tech. By leveraging social media, participating in review programs, freelancing, writing e-books, hosting webinars, and joining review websites, you can diversify your income streams and build a successful career in tech reviews.\nArtificial intelligence, digital marketing, Writng Reviews On Tech Products",

    "summary": "London Tech Week day two: How can tech help solve the climate crisis?\nAs London Tech Week kicks off, Russ Shaw, founder of Tech London Advocates & Global Tech Advocates, gives us the inside scoop on the industry with his daily diary\nA central question in the tech ecosystem is what can tech do to solve the climate crisis.\nTechnology is rightly considered a powerful asset when approaching the target of net-zero, providing the innovative solutions required, backed by investor confidence.\nRecent L&P research found that London-based Climate Tech startups raised $3.5bn, ranking second globally in terms of investment in the sector. More broadly, the sector has a current turnover of £344.6bn and is growing at 11.1 per cent per year.\nTo put things in perspective, the UK cleantech sector is three times the size it was in 2017.\nThese numbers speak volumes , and a clear demonstration of the economic incentive that is coupled with the moral case for urgently finding solutions to the climate crisis, recognising tech as fundamental to the UK's path to net-zero.\nLondon (Clean)tech Week\nLondon (Clean)tech Week\nIt comes as no surprise that at London Tech Week this year, there is a commitment to sustainability, with the event working to achieve carbon net-zero and zero waste.\nAs tech experts from over 100 countries gather in London this week, they will engage with themes addressing today's most pressing issues, showcasing how technology can positively impact society.\nThe focus on a sustainable future at the UK's biggest tech event aims to inspire attendees by providing a platform for decision-makers, industry leaders, and entrepreneurs to implement change.\nToday, attendees at Olympia heard from ClimateTech founders and CEOs, from companies including ENSO and Materials Nexus, as part of a green-focused speaker line-up with the message of providing a better future for our planet through technology.\nIn the festival's fringe events I attended today with Tech in Ghana, Tech Malaysia Advocates and Tech China Advocates, sustainability was a theme across the board. Each group spoke about the importance of net-zero, how we can look after the planet and underlined how tech for net-zero is something that we must work together on to achieve global sustainability goals.\nFurthermore, the ClimateTech Summit returns to London Tech Week once again this year, with speakers from the SOSV, National Grid and Katapult all set to offer their insights.\nThese convening moments all restate the commitment of the tech sector to putting the planet at the forefront of tech decision-making.\nHow tech can lead the green-way\nHow tech can lead the green-way\nThe incentive to position London tech at the heart of our fight against climate change goes beyond the moral argument – though that of course plays a major role too.\nLondon is respected, and renowned around the world, for its approach to climate tech – the fact that investment in climate tech in the UK was only second globally is clear testament to that fact. This tech vertical is a significant asset that brings in billions in investment yearly and has the potential to create thousands of jobs around the country.\nAddressing climate change requires innovative solutions – an area in which tech clearly shines. Just today, high-level representatives from IBM, AVEVA and Cognizant discussed potential usage of AI in reaching a ‘sustainable future'.\nThese are conversations that demonstrate the very best uses of transformational technologies that stand at the frontier of innovation, and it is great to see London Tech Week acting as a crucial facilitator of such insight sharing.\nNo time to waste\nNo time to waste\nUltimately, we are behind in the climate fight.\nThe time for tech in the path to net-zero is now, as it was when hydroelectricity – the first renewable energy source – was created, when wind turbines were manufactured in the late 1800s, or when solar panels were first used in the 1950s.\nThis is tech's moment, and we have an opportunity to push ahead with the climate fight by doubling down on climate tech and the benefits it can deliver.\nWe need to use moments like this week, with 45,000 tech leaders all gathering in London, to galvanise progress and plan how we can accelerate the tech innovation that will shape a sustainable, green future.\nMoments like London Tech Week have the power to inspire solutions and drive forward the urgent action needed to combat climate change.\nRuss Shaw CBE is the founder of Tech London Advocates & Global Tech Advocates\nRuss Shaw CBE is the founder of Tech London Advocates & Global Tech Advocates\nRead more London Tech Week Diary day one: AI takes centre stage",

In time, the groups took over Milwaukee Tech Week, a separate program once known as Startup Milwaukee Week.\nMilky Way Tech Hub is the social impact arm of Jet Constellations, the software development company founded by Nadiyah Johnson. Latinos in Tech was co-founded by Ben Juarez and Carlos Vasquez.\nThis year, October will launch with Milwaukee Tech Week featuring events focused on tech policy and advocacy in southeast Wisconsin, followed by a week focused on community engagement, with an emphasis on women in technology.\nWeek three focuses on STEM education and workforce development, and the fourth and final week will be Midwest Tech Week.\nAs a Black and Latino-led initiative, Wisconsin Tech Month is dedicated to increasing diversity in tech.\nThis year, organizers are making a dedicated effort to reach tech companies and leaders in northeast Wisconsin. That effort is exemplified by the month's launch event, the Wisconsin Tech Month Kick-Off Social being held at Fox Cities Stadium in Appleton in conjunction with Women in Technology and Amplify Oshkosh.\nHere are some of the events during Wisconsin Tech Month.

    "summary": "Virginia Tech Hokies\nThe matchup between Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech is arguably the most anticipated in-conference ACC game this week. Both of these teams have had incredibly high expectations at times.\nHeading into week one, Georgia Tech was riding high after a walk-off win against No. 10 Florida State, a team that at the time seemed much better than what is known now. The Jackets were ranked afterwards, ending a 9-year drought tracing back to September 20, 2015.\nThe Hokies were also close to being ranked by the AP Poll this year, after receiving 77 votes in the intial poll, placing Virginia Tech at 27th in votes, just behind ACC foe Louisville, who was placed at 26th. Since that preseason poll, the Hokies season has been as up-and-down as it gets. The Hokies were upset by Vanderbilt and Rutgers in the first four weeks of the season, then played in a game that went to the referee's discretion against No. 7 Miami, and dominated Stanford and Boston College, 31-7 and 42-21 respectively.\nThese seasons have been very different for the 'Tech' schools, but both teams have three losses heading into 2024's TechMo Bowl, and Virginia Tech is listed as a 10.5-point favorite at DraftKings Sportsbook.\nHere's how we think Virginia Tech's matchup against Georgia Tech will go.\nJackson Caudell (Publisher and Lead Editor), 6-1 record this year: Georgia Tech 27-24\nKahlil McCuller (Writer), 4-3 record this year: Virginia Tech 35-27\nZach Ozmon (Writer), 6-1 record this year: Virginia Tech 24-17\nConnor Mardian (Writer), 4-3 record this year: Virginia Tech 35-17\nRJ Schafer (Writer), 6-1 record this year: Virginia Tech 30-27Additional Links:\nVirginia Tech Football: Hokies Reveal Uniform Combination For Matchup With Georgia Tech\nVirginia Tech Football: Georgia Tech's Brent Key Compares Hokies QB Kyron Drones to Eagles QB Jalen Hurts\nVirginia Tech Football: Three Storylines For Saturday's Game vs Georgia Tech",

    "summary": "For the second year in a row, Chicago did not crack the top 20 for \"tech talent\" in the United States and Canada, according to CBRE.\nChicago doesn't have the highest-paid tech workers. Nor is its workforce dominated by tech employees, especially when compared with other tech hubs.\nFor the second year in a row, the city did not crack the top 20 for \"tech talent\" in the United States and Canada, according to CBRE.\nThe annual report on tech workforce demographics in the U.S. and Canada ranked Chicago No. 23 among the top 50 markets and No. 17 in the United States when looking at the overall strength of its tech talent, based on 13 metrics measuring depth, vitality and attractiveness to companies. The top-ranked talent markets for tech included the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, New York City, Toronto and Austin.\nCREATE YOUR FREE ACCOUNT\nBECOME A MEMBER\nJoin the Chicago Business Journal to unlock even more insights!\nEmail Address *\nPassword * Show\nZip Code * Join Now Sign-in | Premium Memberships\nBy submitting your information you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy and User Agreement.\nBetween office rents and salaries, often the two biggest expenses for tech companies, Chicago is the 15th most-expensive place to run a tech business, costing less than other major metros such as Los Angeles and New York City. Chicago was also considered one of the top education markets as one of a handful of markets with more graduates with tech degrees than jobs for tech talent.\nIn terms of overall tech talent, Chicago's workforce of more than 160,000 workers ranked 10th in the country but saw a 9.5% decrease from 2018 to 2023.\nOther highlights:\nTech talent concentration in Chicago — or the percentage of tech employees as a share of total employment — continues to be low (3.6%) compared with other markets, such as San Francisco (12.3%) and Seattle (9.4%).\nAmong large tech-talent markets, only Washington, D.C., lost more employees from 2018 to 2023 — 19,000 — than Chicago, which lost 16,790.\nTech companies pay wages about 17% above the U.S. average. In Chicago, tech workers make $98,513 on average, the 12th-highest in the country and nearly half the annual wage as San Francisco Bay Area ($192,969).\nChicago ranked 10th in terms of apartment rents, with an average cost of $1,966, an increase of 19% over the last five years.\nCBRE's report also noted the push toward artificial intelligence that continues among tech companies across the U.S. Overall, U.S. tech talent employment grew by 3.6%, or by 213,000 jobs, in 2023, marking a significant slowdown from 2022 when tech talent grew 7.3%. But AI-related jobs increased at double the pace of the rest of tech. While larger markets such as San Francisco and New York have the most AI-specialty talent, Chicago had the ninth-largest share in the U.S.\nSign up for the Business Journal's free daily newsletter to receive the latest business news impacting Chicago.",

    "summary": "For tech professionals aiming to establish their careers in the United States, securing an EB1A green card can be a game-changer. This prestigious category, established by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), offers a path to permanent residency for individuals who demonstrate exceptional talent and significant achievements in their field. While meeting the EB1A criteria requires careful preparation, partnering with specialized firms like us at EB1A Experts can significantly increase the chances of success.\nImpact on tech Professionals' Careers\nAn EB1A green card can dramatically transform a tech professional's career landscape in the United States. It provides the stability and freedom to pursue cutting-edge projects, lead innovative teams, or launch tech startups without the constraints of temporary visas. This newfound security allows tech professionals to focus on pushing technological boundaries and making substantial contributions to their field.\nMoreover, EB1A status elevates a tech professional's standing within the industry. It is a testament to their notable skills and accomplishments, potentially leading to leadership roles, speaking engagements at major tech conferences, and collaborations with industry giants. The flexibility to work for any U.S. tech company or start their venture without sponsorship empowers these professionals to chart their course in the rapidly evolving tech sector.\nLong-term benefits for professional and personal growth\nThe advantages of an EB1A green card extend far beyond immediate career prospects. Tech professionals can establish enduring relationships with industry leaders, venture capitalists, and fellow innovators. This stability fosters an environment conducive to long-term research and development projects, which is crucial in the tech industry.\nOn a personal level, the EB1A green card offers tech professionals and their families a sense of permanence. They can confidently invest in their future in the U.S., whether purchasing property in tech hubs, enrolling children in top schools, or actively participating in local tech communities.\nNavigating the EB1A process with EB1A Experts\nWhile the benefits of an EB1A green card are substantial, meeting the USCIS criteria can be challenging for many talented tech professionals. This is where we at EB1A Experts prove invaluable. We specialize in building firm EB1A profiles and have a proven track record of helping tech professionals succeed in their green card applications.\nWe stand out because we deeply understand how a tech professional's achievements align with EB1A criteria.\nOur comprehensive approach involves:\n1. Evaluating the tech professional's background, including critical projects, product innovations, and industry recognition.\n2. Providing strategic guidance in gathering compelling evidence that showcases technological innovations and their impact.\n3. Crafting an impactful narrative highlighting the tech professional's significant abilities and contributions to the field.\nWhat sets us apart is our ability to build profiles that meet not just three but up to 8-9 of the ten EB1A criteria set by USCIS. This thorough approach significantly reduces the chances of rejection, making the path to a green card faster and more secure for tech professionals.\nBy leveraging our specialized knowledge and proven strategies, tech professionals can confidently navigate the complexities of the USCIS application process. Our track record demonstrates success, with numerous tech clients obtaining their EB1A green cards in as little as six months.\nBy securing an EB1A green card, tech professionals unlock opportunities. They gain the stability to innovate, the credibility to lead, and the flexibility to shape the future of technology in the United States.\nFor those ready to elevate their careers to new heights, the EB1A path, supported by our expertise at EB1A Experts, offers a compelling route to success in the American tech industry.\nBenefits\nFaster processing: For tech professionals, EB-1A often offers quicker processing times than other categories. Premium processing can reduce the initial review to 15 business days, crucial in the fast-paced tech industry.\nPriority in visa bulletin: The \"current\" status often benefits tech professionals from countries with high visa demand, like India and China, where many IT experts originate.\nFamily benefits: Tech professionals' immediate family can also obtain green cards, allowing spouses to work in the tech industry if desired.\nKey Takeaways\n● A significant number of EB1A green card recipients in the tech sector have gone on to found successful startups or assume leadership roles in substantial tech companies within five years of obtaining their green card.\n● The EB1A category allows tech professionals to work on multiple projects or for various employers without restrictions, fostering innovation and technological advancements.",

    "summary": "Over the last few years, Miami has transformed from a place known for beaches and nightlife into one of the fastest-growing tech hotspots in the world. With tech investors, startup founders, and digital workers flocking to the city, Miami's becoming a hub for innovation and it's reshaping the city in many ways. This article breaks down what this tech boom means for Miami's neighborhoods, housing, jobs, and even its unique culture.\nWhy Miami? How it Became a Tech Hotspot\nMiami's rise in the tech world isn't by accident. The city offers attractive perks like no state income tax, which draws both tech entrepreneurs and big tech companies. Miami's location close to Latin America also makes it a strategic choice for companies with international connections. Plus, the sunny weather and vibrant lifestyle are a big draw for those tired of high-pressure tech hubs like Silicon Valley.\nHigh-profile investors like Peter Thiel and others moving to Miami have helped the city gain credibility in tech circles, attracting millions in venture capital funding for startups. This surge of investment has helped Miami's tech scene grow, bringing major changes to the urban landscape.\nBuilding New Infrastructure for a Tech-Driven City\nMiami's buildings and city plans are evolving fast to meet the demands of the growing tech community. Areas like Wynwood, the Design District, and Brickell are filled with new co-working spaces, tech incubators, and creative hubs, attracting talent from all over.\nA standout project is the Miami Innovation District, which focuses on creating spaces for tech startups, research labs, and tech events. Alongside these new developments, Miami is working on public transit upgrades and sustainability measures like bike-sharing and 'smart city' tech that monitors traffic and saves energy.\nThe Housing Challenge: Tech Boom and Rising Rents\nWith more tech companies and workers in Miami, the demand for housing has shot up, raising prices on homes and apartments. While this boosts the local economy, it also makes housing harder to afford, especially for long-time residents. Developers are building high-end condos and apartments targeting tech professionals, but affordable housing options remain limited, causing some people to be priced out of neighborhoods they've lived in for years.\nMiami's government is working with developers to address this by creating affordable units and promoting mixed-income housing. This way, the city can keep its diverse community while welcoming new tech workers.\nNew Jobs, New Skills: The Impact on Miami's Workforce\nMiami's tech scene is creating a wide range of new job opportunities. Beyond startups, traditional industries like banking, healthcare, and tourism are also adding tech positions. This means more high-paying jobs in the city, but many of these roles require specialized skills.\nTo close the skill gap, Miami's schools and colleges are expanding tech courses in areas like coding and AI. Nonprofits and tech companies are also setting up boot camps and workshops to help residents learn the skills needed to succeed in tech roles. This focus on education means that more locals can take advantage of the city's tech boom, rather than seeing these jobs filled by out-of-state workers.\nBlending Tech and Tradition: Miami's Unique Culture\nMiami is a cultural melting pot, with influences from Latin America, the Caribbean, and beyond. The tech boom is bringing new ideas, trends, and tastes into the city, changing everything from restaurants to entertainment. However, there's a strong effort to keep Miami's unique identity alive.\nTech events, like coding camps and conferences, are held alongside cultural festivals and community events, creating a blend of new and traditional. Many tech founders are also working with local artists and musicians to create a uniquely Miami tech scene. This mix keeps Miami exciting for both new residents and tourists who want to experience its special vibe.\nA Greener Miami: Building with the Environment in Mind\nAs a coastal city, Miami faces unique environmental challenges. The tech industry's focus on innovation aligns well with Miami's goal to create a climate-friendly city. New buildings are using eco-friendly materials and energy-saving designs. The city is also investing in climate-proof infrastructure to address issues like rising sea levels and hurricane risk.\nMiami is introducing solar panels, smart grids, and energy-efficient buildings, aiming to become a leader in sustainable urban development.\nLooking Ahead: Miami's Tech Future\nMiami's tech scene is just getting started, but it's already changing the city's skyline, job market, and culture. Balancing growth with affordability and sustainability will be key to ensuring that everyone in Miami can benefit from the tech boom.\nFor young people interested in tech, Miami is becoming a place of opportunity, where new ideas are shaping the city's future. The big question remains: will Miami keep its unique character as it grows into a global tech hub? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure Miami's on the rise, and it's not slowing down.",

    "summary": "Tech lobbying is taking part in a pivotal role in reshaping Florida's regulatory framework. As tech companies continue to expand their presence in the state, their influence on key issues like data privacy, cybersecurity, and workforce development will only grow. For businesses, understanding the impact of tech lobbying is essential for staying competitive and compliant in an increasingly digital economy. Whether you're a tech startup or a traditional business looking to leverage digital tools, staying informed about the regulatory environment in Florida is more important than ever. By keeping an eye on the shifting landscape, businesses can position themselves for success in the Sunshine State's evolving tech ecosystem.\nThe Rise of Tech Lobbying in Florida:\nTech lobbying, the organized effort by technology companies to influence legislation and public policy, has seen a significant increase in Florida over the past decade. While Silicon Valley remains the epicenter of tech innovation, Florida has emerged as an attractive hub for tech startups, thanks to its favorable business environment, lower taxes, and a growing tech talent pool.\nThis rise in tech presence has naturally led to increased lobbying activity. Tech companies are keen to influence Florida's legislative decisions, particularly in areas like data privacy, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. The influx of tech companies in the state is not just about bringing jobs; it's also about ensuring that the regulations governing their operations align with their business models and future growth strategies.\nKey Drivers Behind Tech Lobbying Efforts:\nSeveral factors have contributed to the surge in tech lobbying in Florida:\nData Privacy Laws:\nWith data privacy becoming a hot-button issue globally, Florida has become a battleground for discussions on how personal data should be managed and protected. Tech companies, especially those in social media, e-commerce, and data analytics, are keen to influence how stringent these laws become.\nInfrastructure Investment:\nTech companies are pushing for more investment in digital infrastructure, particularly 5G networks and broadband expansion. Florida's diverse geography, from dense urban areas to rural communities, presents unique challenges that tech lobbying seeks to address.\nTax Incentives and Business-Friendly Policies:\nFlorida has long been known for its low-tax environment, but tech companies want to ensure that new regulations do not disrupt this favorable business climate. Lobbying efforts are often geared towards maintaining or enhancing tax incentives that benefit tech firms.\nWorkforce Development:\nAs the demand for tech talent grows, companies are advocating for policies that promote STEM education and workforce development programs. Ensuring a steady pipeline of skilled workers is crucial for the long-term success of Florida's tech industry.\nThe Impact of Tech Lobbying on Florida's Regulatory Framework:\nTech lobbying in Florida is not just about tweaking existing regulations; it is reshaping the state's entire approach to governance in the digital age. Here are some of the key ways in which tech lobbying is influencing Florida's regulatory framework:\nData Privacy Regulations:\nOne of the most significant areas where tech lobbying has made an impact is in data privacy regulations. Florida has been considering legislation similar to California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which gives consumers more control over how their personal data is collected and used. Tech companies, particularly those heavily reliant on user data, have been actively lobbying to ensure that Florida's version of the law is business-friendly.\nWhile consumer advocates push for stricter privacy protections, tech lobbyists argue that overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation and harm businesses that rely on data for targeted advertising, personalization, and other digital services. The outcome of these lobbying efforts will have far-reaching implications not only for tech companies but also for businesses that operate in sectors where data is a valuable asset.\nCybersecurity and Digital Infrastructure:\nAs Florida continues to position itself as a tech hub, cybersecurity and digital infrastructure have become top priorities. Tech lobbyists are pushing for state investment in robust cybersecurity measures to protect both businesses and consumers from digital threats. This includes advocating for stronger cybersecurity standards, more funding for digital infrastructure, and policies that promote public-private partnerships in cybersecurity.\nAdditionally, tech companies are lobbying for the expansion of 5G networks and broadband internet access across the state. With remote work becoming the norm and digital services expanding, having a reliable and fast digital infrastructure is crucial for the state's economic growth. Lobbying efforts have been instrumental in shaping Florida's approach to these issues.\nTax Policies Favoring Tech Growth:\nFlorida's tax policies have long been a draw for businesses, particularly its lack of state income tax. However, tech companies are advocating for even more favorable tax policies that can help them grow and scale their operations. This includes tax incentives for research and development (R&D), as well as tax breaks for tech startups and venture capital investments.\nThe tech industry's lobbying efforts have focused on ensuring that Florida remains competitive with other states that offer similar incentives. For businesses, particularly startups, these tax policies can make a significant difference in their ability to attract investors and scale quickly.\nWorkforce and Talent Development:\nThe rapid growth of Florida's tech sector has created a strong demand for skilled workers, particularly in areas like software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI). Tech companies have been actively lobbying for policies that promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and workforce development programs.\nThese efforts include advocating for increased funding for STEM programs in schools, expanding apprenticeship and internship opportunities, and creating pathways for tech workers to transition from other industries. For businesses, this focus on talent development is crucial, as it ensures a steady supply of skilled workers needed to stay competitive in the digital age.\nChallenges and Controversies Surrounding Tech Lobbying:\nWhile tech lobbying has undoubtedly shaped Florida's regulatory framework, it has also sparked controversy. Critics argue that tech companies have too much influence over state policy, leading to regulations that favor big business at the expense of consumer protection and fair competition. For example, some consumer advocacy groups have voiced concerns that tech lobbyists are watering down data privacy laws to make them less effective.\nAdditionally, small businesses and startups that lack the resources for large-scale lobbying efforts may find themselves at a disadvantage in a regulatory environment shaped by big tech companies. As tech giants push for regulations that suit their business models, smaller firms may struggle to comply with complex regulatory requirements, creating barriers to entry and stifling innovation.\nWhat Businesses Should Know:\nFor businesses operating in Florida, the influence of tech lobbying on the regulatory framework presents both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, tech-friendly regulations can create a more favorable environment for businesses that rely on digital tools and services. On the other hand, the evolving regulatory landscape can create compliance challenges, particularly in areas like data privacy and cybersecurity.\nBusinesses should stay informed about changes to Florida's regulatory environment, particularly those influenced by tech lobbying. Engaging with industry groups and staying active in policy discussions can help businesses navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure their interests are represented.\nConclusion:\nSince recent years, technology has advanced at an unprecedented rate, and with it, the role of tech companies has evolved from being mere providers of digital services to powerful stakeholders shaping state policies. Nowhere is this more evident than in Florida, where tech lobbying efforts have begun to reshape the regulatory landscape. The Sunshine State, once known for its relaxed regulatory environment, is now at the forefront of a transformation driven by the tech industry's growing influence. For businesses operating in Florida or looking to expand into this market, understanding the implications of tech lobbying on the regulatory framework is essential. This article provides key insights into how tech lobbying is reshaping Florida's regulations and what it means for businesses.",

    "summary": "Georgia Tech has been a big underdog all week leading up to the game vs Virginia Tech and with starting quarterback Haynes King ruled out for another game, the Yellow Jackets are going to remain big underdogs. According to the odds at Caesars Sportsbook, Georgia Tech is going to be a 10.5 point underdog today vs the Hokies.\nHere is how you can watch Saturday's game.\nTV: ACC Network\n• Play-by-Play: Chris Cotter\n• Analyst: Mark Herzlich\n• Sideline Reporter: Coley Harvey\n• Mobile App: ESPN\n• Online: WatchESPN.com\nRADIO: Georgia Tech Sports Network\n• Play-by-Play: Andy Demetra\n• Analyst: Andrew Gardner\n• Sideline Reporter: Chris Mooneyham\n• In Atlanta: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan\n• Across Georgia: Visit RamblinWreck.com for station affiliate list\n• Satellite: SiriusXM 85\n• Mobile Apps: GT Yellow Jackets, 680 The Fan, SiriusXM, TuneIn\n• Online: RamblinWreck.com, 680TheFan.com\nI think there are going to be a few critical areas where this game is going to be decided. The Georgia Tech offensive line vs the Virginia Tech pass rush, plus Georgia Tech's rush offense vs the Virginia Tech rush defense.\nThe Hokies come into this game tied for 4th in the nation in sacks, while Georgia Tech is third in the country in sacks given up, only allowing three sacks all season. Two of those sacks came on Saturday vs Notre Dame and Virginia Tech arguably has a better pass rush than the Fighting Irish. Virginia Tech defensive end Antwaun Powell-Ryland is tied for first in the nation with 11 sacks and he just had a four-sack performance vs Boston College on Thursday night. This is going to be a huge test for the Yellow Jackets and could be one of the deciding factors in the game.\nThe Yellow Jackets entered Saturday's game vs Notre Dame as the No. 1 rushing attack in the ACC. After that game, they are not even in the top five in the conference anymore. They dropped all the way to No. 6 after a bad performance on Saturday.\nJamal Haynes was playing his best football coming into the game, but give Notre Dame a lot of credit for not letting him get going. He finished with eight carries for 15 yards. Chad Alexander had five carries for 19 carries and Pyron finished with 13 carries for 45 yards.\nVirginia Tech has the second-worst rush defense in the ACC coming into the game. Can Georgia Tech find a way to take advantage?\nAdditional Links:\nReport: Georgia Tech Quarterback Haynes King Officially Ruled Out For Saturday's Game vs Virginia Tech\nGeorgia Tech vs Virginia Tech: Game Preview, Matchup Breakdown, and Final Score Prediction\nGeorgia Tech vs Virginia Tech: Three Virginia Tech Defenders To Watch On Saturday Against The Yellow Jackets",

    "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic shook the world in unprecedented ways. Every industry, country, and person felt its effects. While many regions experienced significant economic slowdowns, some, like Florida, saw an unexpected surge in certain sectors. Florida's tech industry witnessed rapid growth during the pandemic, driven by several key factors.\nFlorida's Pre-Pandemic Tech Terrain\nBefore the pandemic, Florida had a growing tech scene. However, it wasn't considered a major player in the tech world like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or New York. The state was more known for tourism, real estate, and agriculture. Tech companies existed, but they weren't dominant.\nCities like Miami, Orlando, and Tampa were developing their tech ecosystems. Tech startups were slowly gaining traction. Still, many companies saw the state as a secondary option. The relatively low cost of living, absence of state income tax, and attractive lifestyle made Florida appealing, but the tech infrastructure wasn't fully developed.\nHowever, everything changed with COVID-19.\nThe Remote Work Revolution\nOne of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 was the shift to remote work. Tech companies, which had already been adopting flexible work practices, quickly moved to fully remote operations. This shift allowed employees to work from anywhere, leading many to leave expensive cities like San Francisco and New York for more affordable and desirable locations.\nFlorida became a top destination for these tech workers. The state's warm weather, relatively affordable housing, and lack of income tax made it an attractive option. People began to move to cities like Miami, Tampa, and Orlando in droves, fueling a tech migration that Florida had never seen before.\nMoreover, this migration wasn't just limited to employees. Tech entrepreneurs and companies began to relocate as well. Startups and established firms realized they no longer needed to be tied to the high costs and congestion of traditional tech hubs. Florida became a hotspot for innovation as companies looked for a more favorable business environment.\nInflux of Venture Capital\nAlong with the migration of tech talent came an increase in venture capital investments. Historically, Florida lagged behind states like California and New York in attracting venture capital. Investors were cautious about backing startups outside of established tech ecosystems.\nBut during the pandemic, investors began to see the potential in Florida's growing tech scene. The influx of talent meant more startups were being founded, and the state's business-friendly policies made it easier for them to thrive. As a result, venture capital firms started to pay more attention to Florida.\nIn 2020 alone, venture capital investment in Florida increased significantly. Cities like Miami began attracting national attention as a potential new tech hub. This infusion of capital further fueled the tech boom, enabling startups to scale faster and more efficiently.\nThe Rise of Miami as a Tech Hub\nAmong Florida's cities, Miami emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the pandemic-induced tech boom. The city, long known for its tourism and real estate industries, saw a dramatic transformation. Spearheaded by local leaders like Mayor Francis Suarez, Miami actively positioned itself as the next big tech hub.\nMayor Suarez's famous tweet, 'How can I help?' in response to a Silicon Valley investor's musings about moving to Miami went viral, and it marked the beginning of the city's tech renaissance. Tech founders, venture capitalists, and engineers began moving to Miami, attracted by the city's pro-business attitude and appealing lifestyle.\nThe city also benefited from its diverse population and proximity to Latin America, positioning it as a bridge between the U.S. and international markets. Latin American tech companies looking to expand into the U.S. found Miami to be an ideal entry point.\nMoreover, Miami's tech community fostered a sense of collaboration and innovation. New co-working spaces, accelerators, and tech meetups sprang up, creating a vibrant ecosystem that rivaled more established hubs. The city's growing reputation as a tech destination attracted even more talent and investment.\nTech-Friendly Policies and Business Climate\nFlorida's government also played a significant role in fostering the tech boom. The state's tax policies, including the absence of state income tax, made it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and tech workers alike. Businesses saw the potential to lower their operating costs by relocating to Florida, and individuals enjoyed the opportunity to keep more of their earnings.\nAdditionally, Florida's relatively relaxed approach to pandemic restrictions compared to other states allowed businesses to continue operating with fewer interruptions. While this approach sparked debate, it undeniably contributed to Florida's economic resilience and helped attract more companies looking for stability during uncertain times.\nThe state also made efforts to improve its tech infrastructure. Initiatives to enhance internet connectivity and support for tech education helped create a more favorable environment for tech companies. These steps, combined with the influx of talent and capital, accelerated the growth of Florida's tech sector.\nChallenges of the Tech Boom\nWhile Florida's tech boom brought numerous benefits, it also presented challenges. The rapid growth strained the state's infrastructure, particularly in cities like Miami, where housing demand skyrocketed. Home prices surged, making it difficult for some long-time residents to afford living in their own neighborhoods. The influx of new residents also put pressure on public services and transportation systems.\nAdditionally, while the tech sector boomed, other industries in Florida, particularly tourism, suffered significant losses due to the pandemic. This created an uneven economic recovery, with some areas thriving while others struggled.\nThe shift to remote work also raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the tech boom. While many companies embraced remote work during the pandemic, some began to bring employees back to the office as restrictions eased. If remote work trends shift again, it could affect Florida's tech growth.\nLong-Term Impacts on Florida's Economy\nDespite these challenges, the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on Florida's tech boom are expected to be largely positive. The pandemic acted as a catalyst, accelerating trends that were already in motion. Florida's tech ecosystem is now more robust than ever, with a diverse range of startups, established companies, and investors fueling its growth.\nThe state's tech sector is expected to continue expanding, driven by factors like its favorable tax policies, quality of life, and growing reputation as a tech hub. Miami, in particular, is likely to remain a focal point of this growth, attracting more companies and talent from around the world.\nFurthermore, the rise of Florida's tech industry could have broader implications for the state's economy. As tech companies continue to grow, they will create high-paying jobs and spur innovation in other sectors. This diversification will help Florida reduce its reliance on industries like tourism and real estate, making its economy more resilient to future disruptions.\nConclusion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the global economy in profound ways, and Florida's tech boom is one of the most notable outcomes. The state, once primarily known for its tourism and real estate industries, has now emerged as a major player in the tech world. The shift to remote work, an influx of venture capital, and tech-friendly policies all contributed to this transformation. While challenges remain, the long-term outlook for Florida's tech industry is bright. The pandemic may have started the boom, but the factors driving it—talent, investment, and innovation—are likely to keep Florida's tech sector thriving for years to come.",

    "excerpt": "Only two OSU freshmen have ever thrown for more yards in their first career start and Smith's performance ranks fifth among OSU freshmen all-time.",
    "summary": "STILLWATER — Maealiuaki answered every possible question on Saturday except one.\nWhy did it take so long for Oklahoma State to hand him the keys to the offense?\n'It'll be able to generate a lot of talk is, why wasn't he playing two months ago?' Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. 'But we would have never known two months ago. One guy (Zane Flores) broke his foot, and the other guy (Garret Rangel) broke his collarbone. Otherwise, we wouldn't even know about that today. So it's just a very unusual situation.'\nSmith started the season on the scout team and didn't even begin practicing Oklahoma State's own offense until mid-October. Whether Smith could have or even should have taken meaningful practice reps earlier in the season, Gundy couldn't say following Saturday's 56-48 loss to Texas Tech.\n'You're not going to take a true freshman and start giving him reps with the ones or twos when he walks right in from high school,' Gundy said.\nSmith certainly did his best to shed doubt on that philosophy on Saturday, completing 26-of-36 passes for 326 yards, a touchdown, and a late-game interception that came when Smith was attempting to lead a touchdown drive with less than 20 seconds remaining in the game.\nOnly two OSU freshmen have ever thrown for more yards in their first career start (Wes Lunt and Aso Pogi) and his performance ranks fifth among OSU freshmen all-time. His completion percentage of 72% is the highest for any Oklahoma State quarterback in a start against a Power Four opponent since Shane Illingworth completed 73.9% against a Kansas team that finished 0-9 in 2020.\n'Man, I mean, he just did so good,' OSU receiver De'Zhaun Stribling said. 'You know, you wouldn't think it was his first start, or even he's a true freshman. I mean, just the way he was out there playing was just amazing.'\nStribling caught Smith's lone touchdown pass in the end zone 14 yards downfield on a play that took a little bit to develop.\n'I'm probably the last progression on that concept, and he went through the whole front side, didn't see nothing, came back to the back side, and found me open,' Stribling said. 'But just props to him staying in the pocket and make a good throw and just staying there. He's doing really great.\n'He's gonna be a great player here. The way he's progressing, the way he's learning, and pay attention to all of his details and assignments, he's good.'\nThe play that really got his receivers' attention was Smith's 13-yard touchdown run to tie the game up halfway through the third quarter.\n'That was pretty, it was pretty bold, you know,' OSU receiver Rashod Owens said when asked if any of Smith's plays surprised the senior. 'I won't say bold, but it's just, he made a great play. You know, he read the d-end perfectly, and, you know, he pulled it and ran it in for a touchdown.'\nStribling didn't mince his words so much.\n'Just having the balls to run it and not be scared to get hit, that's just great,' Stribling said.\nNot counting attempts when Smith dove on loose fumbles, or sacks, the freshman quarterback finished with 26 rushing yards on four carries.\nGundy felt like that was a major factor in the running game as Oklahoma State's running backs carried the ball 21 times for 200 rushing yards and four touchdowns. The group was paced by running back Ollie Gordon, who finished with a season-high 156 and three touchdowns while averaging a season-best 10.4 yards per carry. Gordon's previous best average this season was a 6.7 effort against BYU.\n'We had the fear of a quarterback that could keep the ball and move around a little bit,' Gundy said. 'Defenses are going to play you a little bit different.'\nConsidering the BYU game also saw Oklahoma State's offense explode behind a mobile quarterback, maybe the Cowboys should consider that a requirement for future passers instead of a nice addition.\nWhen asked that very question in the postgame, Gundy agreed with the sentiment without actually saying the quarterback in 2025 has to be a dual threat.\n'When you have a quarterback, doesn't have to be a runner, but when he can maneuver himself enough to where, if the protection breaks down he can run for 6, 8 or 10 or 12 (yards), or if you need to run him in a situation and he can not get 2 or 3, he can't get 8 or 10 or 12, it helps your offense,' Gundy said. 'I mean, it becomes a numbers game.'\nGundy and both receivers praised Smith's composure throughout Saturday's game. Owens said Smith spent almost every free minute on the sidelines glued to the tablets, trying to make adjustments, which fits somewhat with Gundy's description of the freshman.\n'He doesn't say much,' Gundy said. 'He's just very to himself. Good lord gave him two ears and one mouth. He uses it that way. He listens twice as much as he talks. He doesn't say a lot, but I thought he was very poised.'\nJust don't mistake his quiet focus for passiveness. Once the offense huddled up, the freshman set the tone for a group that often consisted of eight-plus seniors.\n'It was his offense today,' Stribling said. 'It was his offense. How he moved is how we all moved, his confidence, his attitude. He made everything happen.'\nPhotos: Oklahoma State loses final home game to Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\nOklahoma State takes on Texas Tech\ntyler.waldrep@tulsaworld.com\n0 Comments\nTyler Waldrep\nOSU Sports Writer\nAuthor facebook\nAuthor twitter\nAuthor email\nFollow Tyler Waldrep",

    "summary": "New York City is not only a global hub for finance, fashion, and media but also a growing force in technology. Over the past few decades, the city's tech industry has flourished, shaping both its economy and terrain. As tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook expand their footprints, the city's urban development is swiftly transforming. From changing neighborhoods to influencing infrastructure, the impact of New York's tech industry on urban development is profound and far-reaching.\nThe Growth of New York's Tech Industry\nHistorically, New York was synonymous with industries like finance, real estate, and advertising. However, in recent years, its tech industry has grown at an impressive rate. The city's strategic location, access to talent, and vibrant startup culture have all contributed to this boom. New York now ranks as one of the top tech ecosystems in the world, rivaling Silicon Valley.\nThis fast growth is not just about startups. Major tech companies have established significant offices in the city. Google's Chelsea office, for instance, is a key example of how tech has rooted itself in the heart of Manhattan. Similarly, Amazon's expansion in Long Island City, although controversial, highlighted the city's appeal to tech firms. These companies aren't just leasing office spaces. They are also influencing the real estate market, local employment, and infrastructure.\nTech Companies and the Changing Face of Real Estate\nOne of the most noticeable impacts of the tech industry on New York's urban development is the transformation of real estate. As tech companies continue to grow, their demand for office space has surged. Traditionally industrial neighborhoods like Chelsea, Dumbo, and Long Island City have been transformed into tech hubs.\nChelsea, once known for its art galleries and industrial spaces, is now home to one of the largest tech office spaces in the city—Google's headquarters. This shift has brought with it a wave of development. New luxury apartments, commercial spaces, and amenities are being built to cater to tech workers. The influx of high-paying tech jobs has driven up property values, making these neighborhoods more expensive and sometimes displacing long-time residents.\nIn Brooklyn, the tech industry's influence is particularly evident in areas like Dumbo and Downtown Brooklyn. What was once a neighborhood of abandoned warehouses has now been revitalized. Startups, tech firms, and co-working spaces dominate the area. The increase in demand for office space has led to new high-rise developments, altering the neighborhood's skyline.\nInfrastructure Developments Driven by Tech\nAs the tech industry grows, so does the need for improved infrastructure. The city's public transportation system, already strained by a growing population, is facing increased demand from the influx of tech workers. Neighborhoods that were once less accessible are now being developed to accommodate the new workforce.\nFor example, the expansion of ferry services, bike lanes, and improved subway access to areas like Long Island City and Dumbo reflects the city's efforts to support the tech industry. The demand for better internet connectivity and faster broadband speeds has also led to infrastructure upgrades. New York's tech sector thrives on innovation, and reliable internet is crucial for its success.\nIn response, city planners and private firms have invested heavily in expanding fiber-optic networks across the city. This investment not only benefits tech companies but also local residents, enhancing their access to high-speed internet. Moreover, tech companies themselves are investing in the city's infrastructure. Google, for example, has been involved in improving public spaces around its Chelsea offices, creating green spaces and community amenities.\nUrban Revitalization and Gentrification\nWhile the tech industry has undoubtedly brought economic benefits, it has also contributed to gentrification. Neighborhoods like Williamsburg and the Lower East Side have seen a dramatic shift in demographics, driven in part by the influx of young tech professionals.\nThis gentrification has resulted in increased property prices and the displacement of long-time residents. In Williamsburg, for example, new luxury condominiums have replaced old industrial buildings, pushing out local businesses and residents. The arrival of tech companies and their employees has transformed these areas, raising concerns about the long-term impact on community diversity and affordability.\nHowever, it's not all negative. The tech industry has also brought revitalization to neighborhoods that were previously neglected. In areas like the Bronx and Queens, tech-driven developments have spurred economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for local residents. The key challenge is ensuring that this growth is inclusive and that the benefits of urban development are shared by all.\nTech's Influence on the Future of Workspaces\nAnother significant impact of New York's tech industry on urban development is the changing nature of workspaces. Traditional office buildings are being redesigned to accommodate the needs of tech companies. Open floor plans, flexible workspaces, and communal areas are becoming the norm, reflecting the tech industry's emphasis on collaboration and innovation.\nThe rise of co-working spaces is also a direct result of the tech boom. Companies like WeWork, which originated in New York, have revolutionized the way people work. These spaces cater to startups, freelancers, and remote workers, providing flexible office solutions in prime locations. As a result, traditional office leasing models are being challenged, and developers are now focusing on creating more adaptable workspaces.\nThe Role of Technology in Sustainable Urban Development\nThe tech industry is also playing a pivotal role in driving sustainable urban development. Tech companies are increasingly aware of their environmental impact and are investing in green buildings and eco-friendly technologies. Google's New York office, for example, has been designed with sustainability in mind, featuring energy-efficient systems and promoting green practices.\nMoreover, the rise of smart city technologies, driven by tech firms, is reshaping how cities like New York are planned and managed. From smart traffic lights to energy-efficient buildings, technology is being used to create more sustainable and livable urban environments. The tech industry's push for innovation is helping the city address challenges like congestion, pollution, and energy consumption.\nConclusion\nThe impact of New York's tech industry on urban development is undeniable. As tech companies continue to expand, their influence on real estate, infrastructure, and community development will only grow. While the economic benefits are clear, the city must also address the challenges of gentrification and displacement to ensure that urban development is inclusive.\nNew York's tech industry has the potential to shape a more sustainable and innovative urban future. However, achieving this requires collaboration between the public and private sectors. By balancing growth with inclusivity, New York can continue to thrive as a leading tech hub while ensuring that its development benefits all residents. The intersection of tech and urban development offers exciting possibilities for the city's future.",

    "summary": "The future of tech talent in Australia is shaping up to be dynamic and promising. The Tech Council of Australia (TCA) is at the forefront of this movement. Through initiatives like its Partner Forum, the TCA is addressing the nation's growing tech workforce shortage. With industries from retail to mining embracing digital transformation, the demand for skilled tech workers is higher than ever.\nBut how is Australia tackling this challenge? The answer lies in collaboration, innovation, and strategic programs.\nWhy Tech Talent Matters to Australia\nTech talent is not just essential for technology companies—it's a necessity across the entire Australian economy. Around 62% of the country's tech workers are employed outside of traditional tech industries. Companies in banking, mining, and retail now rely heavily on tech solutions to modernize operations and improve efficiency.\nThe Tech Council of Australia understands this shift. It's pushing for greater technology adoption in every sector. This doesn't only benefit tech companies but also helps non-tech organizations develop their own tech capabilities. The Partner Forum is at the heart of this initiative, bringing together industry leaders to foster innovation and develop new pipelines for tech talent.\nThe Role of the TCA's Partner Forum\nThe Tech Council of Australia's Partner Forum is a platform for tackling key industry challenges. Rapid advancements in AI and increasing cybersecurity threats highlight the need for skilled tech workers. To address this, the Partner Forum unites large organizations such as Commonwealth Bank and NBN Co. Together, they discuss strategies for building tech talent pipelines and promoting technology adoption.\nRichard White, CEO of WiseTech, believes that tech talent isn't limited to tech companies. Many workers are employed in sectors like finance and logistics, supporting the broader economy. The Partner Forum acts as a bridge, connecting industries and helping them shape a stronger future for Australia's tech talent.\nHow Technology Companies Develop Tech Talent\nTechnology companies are not just employing tech talent—they are nurturing it. WiseTech, one of the major players, has launched the Earn and Learn Program. This initiative provides students with real-world experience in software engineering while they complete their degrees. The goal is to prepare students for a career in tech by giving them hands-on experience.\nAnother innovative project is the Virtual Work Experience Program. It has benefited over 2,000 learners in fields like data science, software engineering, and cybersecurity. These programs are part of the TCA's broader strategy to close the skills gap and develop a robust tech workforce.\nTechnology Adoption Beyond Tech Companies\nTech adoption in Australia is not limited to tech firms. Various industries, from healthcare to agriculture, are embracing technology to enhance their operations. The TCA sees this as a critical trend for the country's economic growth. By joining the Partner Forum, companies across different sectors can access resources and share insights on building their tech capabilities.\nThe Tech Council of Australia believes that technology should not only drive business growth but also contribute to workforce development. The Partner Forum provides a space for companies to collaborate, shape policies, and invest in technology adoption.\nEmbracing Diversity in the Tech Workforce\nThe tech industry in Australia has a diversity problem. Women represent only 28% of the IT workforce. The Tech Council of Australia recognizes this issue and is working to create a more inclusive environment. Programs focused on empowering underrepresented groups and fostering tech skills are critical to closing the gender gap.\nThe closure of initiatives like the Boosting Female Founders Program is a setback, but the TCA remains committed to supporting diversity and inclusion in tech. An inclusive workforce is not just beneficial for companies—it's essential for innovation and growth.\nThe Australian Government's Role\nThe Australian government has set a target of creating 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources is actively monitoring this progress. As of May 2023, the number of tech jobs in the country was at 930,000. The TCA estimates that AI alone will create an additional 200,000 jobs by the end of the decade.\nBut to reach these goals, Australia needs to address its skills shortage. The Tech Council of Australia is calling for more investment in education and reskilling initiatives. This requires a coordinated effort from the government, industries, and educational institutions.\nBuilding a Future-Ready Tech Workforce\nThe future of tech talent in Australia relies on collaboration. The Tech Council of Australia's Partner Forum is encouraging stakeholders to come together, innovate, and build a stronger tech workforce. Technology companies play a crucial role in talent development, but the entire ecosystem—government, industries, and communities—must work together to achieve sustainable growth.\nTechnology adoption is spreading across industries, creating new opportunities for tech professionals. This trend will continue to redefine the workforce as businesses seek to modernize and enhance their operations.\nConclusion\nThe future of tech talent in Australia is filled with both challenges and opportunities. The Tech Council of Australia is making strides to ensure that the nation is prepared for the future. Through its Partner Forum, the TCA is pushing for increased technology adoption, workforce innovation, and a more inclusive tech environment.\nWith continued support from the government and the collaboration of industries, Australia can achieve its ambitious goal of creating 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030. By nurturing the next generation of tech professionals and embracing diversity, Australia's tech sector is poised for a bright and sustainable future.\nThe journey ahead is not easy, but with a shared vision and commitment, the Tech Council of Australia and its Partner Forum will play a pivotal role in shaping the nation's tech talent landscape.",

    "summary": "Georgia Tech has been a big underdog all week leading up to the game vs Virginia Tech and with starting quarterback Haynes King ruled out for another game, the Yellow Jackets are going to remain big underdogs. According to the odds at Caesars Sportsbook, Georgia Tech is going to be a 10.5 point underdog today vs the Hokies.\nHere is how you can watch Saturday's game.\nTV: ACC Network\n• Play-by-Play: Chris Cotter\n• Analyst: Mark Herzlich\n• Sideline Reporter: Coley Harvey\n• Mobile App: ESPN\n• Online: WatchESPN.com\nRADIO: Georgia Tech Sports Network\n• Play-by-Play: Andy Demetra\n• Analyst: Andrew Gardner\n• Sideline Reporter: Chris Mooneyham\n• In Atlanta: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan\n• Across Georgia: Visit RamblinWreck.com for station affiliate list\n• Satellite: SiriusXM 85\n• Mobile Apps: GT Yellow Jackets, 680 The Fan, SiriusXM, TuneIn\n• Online: RamblinWreck.com, 680TheFan.com\nI think there are going to be a few critical areas where this game is going to be decided. The Georgia Tech offensive line vs the Virginia Tech pass rush, plus Georgia Tech's rush offense vs the Virginia Tech rush defense.\nThe Hokies come into this game tied for 4th in the nation in sacks, while Georgia Tech is third in the country in sacks given up, only allowing three sacks all season. Two of those sacks came on Saturday vs Notre Dame and Virginia Tech arguably has a better pass rush than the Fighting Irish. Virginia Tech defensive end Antwaun Powell-Ryland is tied for first in the nation with 11 sacks and he just had a four-sack performance vs Boston College on Thursday night. This is going to be a huge test for the Yellow Jackets and could be one of the deciding factors in the game.\nThe Yellow Jackets entered Saturday's game vs Notre Dame as the No. 1 rushing attack in the ACC. After that game, they are not even in the top five in the conference anymore. They dropped all the way to No. 6 after a bad performance on Saturday.\nJamal Haynes was playing his best football coming into the game, but give Notre Dame a lot of credit for not letting him get going. He finished with eight carries for 15 yards. Chad Alexander had five carries for 19 carries and Pyron finished with 13 carries for 45 yards.\nVirginia Tech has the second-worst rush defense in the ACC coming into the game. Can Georgia Tech find a way to take advantage?\nAdditional Links:\nReport: Georgia Tech Quarterback Haynes King Officially Ruled Out For Saturday's Game vs Virginia Tech\nGeorgia Tech vs Virginia Tech: Game Preview, Matchup Breakdown, and Final Score Prediction\nGeorgia Tech vs Virginia Tech: Three Virginia Tech Defenders To Watch On Saturday Against The Yellow Jackets",

    "summary": "The tech industry is thriving across the United States, with certain cities gaining more prominence than others. For years, Silicon Valley and New York have been synonymous with innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological advancements. However, a new contender is rising—Florida. Traditionally known for its tourism and real estate, the Sunshine State is now emerging as a tech hub, attracting entrepreneurs, investors, and skilled professionals. Florida's tech industry is growing at a rapid pace, and it's giving the established giants like Silicon Valley and New York some serious competition.\nA Favorable Business Environment\nOne of the primary reasons Florida is becoming an attractive destination for tech companies is its favorable business environment. Unlike New York and California, Florida boasts a low-tax structure, with no state income tax, which is a significant draw for entrepreneurs and investors alike. This tax advantage means more disposable income for businesses and employees, which can be reinvested in growth, innovation, and attracting talent.\nFurthermore, the cost of living in Florida is relatively lower than in the established tech hubs. Rent, housing, and operational costs are more affordable, allowing startups and tech firms to stretch their budgets further. This financial flexibility has made Florida particularly appealing for small to medium-sized tech enterprises that might struggle with the high expenses in Silicon Valley or New York.\nEmerging Tech Cities\nWhile Miami is leading the charge, cities like Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville are also becoming tech hubs in their own right. Miami, often dubbed the 'next Silicon Valley,' has become a hotspot for venture capital and tech startups. With its international connections, particularly with Latin America, Miami serves as a gateway for tech companies looking to expand globally. The city's vibrant culture and growing reputation as a tech hub have drawn in entrepreneurs from across the world.\nOrlando, traditionally known for its theme parks, is now gaining recognition for its tech scene. The presence of major universities and research institutions has fostered innovation in fields like aerospace, simulation technology, and gaming. Tampa and Jacksonville are also seeing rapid growth in sectors such as cybersecurity, fintech, and health tech. This diversification across different cities is allowing Florida to build a robust, decentralized tech ecosystem that can compete with the concentrated tech scenes of Silicon Valley and New York.\nTalent Attraction and Retention\nTalent is the lifeblood of the tech industry, and one of the critical factors in Florida's rise as a tech hub is its ability to attract and retain skilled professionals. In recent years, Florida has seen an influx of talent from both coasts. Many tech professionals are leaving Silicon Valley and New York due to the high cost of living and seeking out more affordable and sustainable lifestyles in Florida.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend of remote work, allowing tech workers to relocate without leaving their jobs. Florida's sunny weather, vibrant lifestyle, and lower living costs make it an ideal destination for tech professionals looking for a change in environment. The state's universities, including the University of Florida, Florida State University, and the University of Miami, are also churning out a new generation of tech-savvy graduates, ensuring a steady pipeline of local talent.\nInvestment and Venture Capital\nFor any tech ecosystem to thrive, access to funding is crucial. While Silicon Valley and New York have long dominated the venture capital space, Florida is catching up. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in venture capital investment in Florida-based tech startups. Major venture capital firms, as well as angel investors, are recognizing Florida's potential and are pouring money into the state's growing tech scene.\nMiami, in particular, has seen a surge in investment activity, with numerous high-profile tech companies setting up shop in the city. This influx of capital is fueling innovation, allowing startups to scale rapidly and compete on a national and global level. The increase in investment has also attracted more entrepreneurs to Florida, further strengthening its position as a viable alternative to Silicon Valley and New York.\nSupportive Infrastructure\nA tech hub cannot thrive without the necessary infrastructure to support it. Florida has been making strides in building the infrastructure needed to sustain its growing tech industry. The state is home to several incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces that foster innovation and collaboration among startups. These spaces provide entrepreneurs with access to mentorship, networking opportunities, and resources that are vital for business growth.\nAdditionally, Florida's transportation network, including major international airports, ports, and highways, makes it an ideal location for tech companies that need to operate globally. Miami International Airport, for example, is one of the busiest international hubs in the U.S., providing easy access to Latin America and other international markets. This connectivity is a significant advantage for tech companies looking to expand their reach beyond the U.S.\nA Growing Tech Ecosystem\nFlorida's tech ecosystem is growing in diversity, with a wide range of sectors represented. From fintech and health tech to aerospace and cybersecurity, Florida's tech industry is far from a one-trick pony. This diversity is helping to attract different types of businesses and investors, creating a dynamic and resilient tech scene.\nThe state's growing tech ecosystem is also supported by a collaborative business community. Organizations like the Florida High Tech Corridor, eMerge Americas, and Techstars have been instrumental in fostering connections between startups, investors, and industry leaders. These organizations provide valuable resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities that help tech companies thrive.\nMoreover, the presence of established tech companies in the state is helping to solidify Florida's reputation as a tech hub. Major corporations like Magic Leap, Citrix, and Chewy have set up headquarters or significant operations in Florida, providing a strong foundation for the state's tech ecosystem to grow.\nGovernment Support and Incentives\nFlorida's government has been proactive in supporting the growth of the tech industry. The state offers various incentives for businesses, including tax credits, grants, and workforce training programs. These incentives have been designed to attract tech companies and encourage them to establish operations in Florida.\nIn addition to financial incentives, the state has been investing in education and workforce development to ensure that there is a steady supply of skilled tech workers. Florida's universities and technical schools are partnering with tech companies to develop curricula that align with the needs of the industry. This collaboration between the public and private sectors is helping to build a strong talent pipeline and ensuring that Florida remains competitive in the tech space.\nCompeting with the Giants\nWhile Silicon Valley and New York have the advantage of being established tech hubs with a long history of innovation, Florida is proving that it has what it takes to compete. The state's favorable business environment, growing talent pool, increasing investment, and supportive infrastructure are all contributing to its rise as a tech hub.\nOne area where Florida is particularly competitive is quality of life. While tech professionals in Silicon Valley and New York may enjoy high salaries, they often have to contend with sky-high living costs and a fast-paced, stressful lifestyle. In contrast, Florida offers a more balanced and affordable way of life, without sacrificing career opportunities. This quality of life advantage is attracting more and more tech workers and entrepreneurs to the Sunshine State, helping to fuel its tech industry's growth.\nConclusion\nFlorida's tech industry is on the rise, and it's becoming a serious contender in the national tech landscape. With a favorable business environment, growing investment, and a supportive ecosystem, Florida is proving that it can compete with established tech hubs like Silicon Valley and New York. As more talent and capital flow into the state, Florida's tech scene is only expected to grow stronger in the coming years. For entrepreneurs, investors, and tech professionals looking for the next big thing, Florida is certainly a place to watch.",

    "summary": "Texas, known for its vast space, rich cultural history, and economic might, has emerged as a technological powerhouse in recent years. As the tech industry continues to transform, it is not only transforming business landscapes but also driving significant job creation across the state. From Austin's Silicon Hills to Dallas's robust tech scene, Texas has established itself as a key player in the national and global tech ecosystem.\nA Thriving Tech Hub: Texas's Position in the U.S. Tech Market\nTexas's tech industry ranks among the largest in the United States, with the state consistently attracting major players like Dell, Texas Instruments, Apple, Oracle, and Google. The cities of Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio have emerged as tech hubs, each contributing to the expansion of the tech workforce. The state's pro-business climate, relatively affordable cost of living, and its strong infrastructure support make it an appealing destination for tech companies and professionals alike.\nIn addition to well-established corporations, Texas has become a fertile ground for startups and emerging tech firms. The surge in venture capital investment, incubators, and innovation labs has enabled smaller companies to thrive, thereby contributing to the rapid creation of new job opportunities across a variety of tech subfields. These include software development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and financial technology, to name a few.\nMajor Tech Companies Driving Employment\nSeveral major tech companies have set up or expanded their operations in Texas, leading to a tech-driven employment boom. Apple, for instance, has invested heavily in expanding its presence in Austin with its sprawling campus, which is projected to employ thousands of workers. Similarly, Oracle's relocation of its headquarters to Austin further cemented the city's standing as a tech epicenter, bringing with it new jobs in software development, engineering, and IT services.\nDallas, with companies like Texas Instruments and AT&T, also plays a vital role in shaping the local job market. Texas Instruments, a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, has long been a cornerstone of Dallas's economy, employing tens of thousands of workers. As Texas Instruments continues to innovate in chip manufacturing, the company also drives demand for skilled talent, contributing to job growth in both high-tech manufacturing and research.\nFurthermore, Houston, known for its oil and energy sector, has embraced technological innovation. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise have made significant investments in Houston's tech sector, particularly in cloud computing and enterprise software solutions, leading to job creation in various IT and development roles. Overall, Texas's tech industry is not limited to a single city, but spreads across its major metropolitan areas, each contributing to the state's employment growth.\nStartups and Emerging Tech: A Key Contributor to Job Growth\nWhile major tech companies play a crucial role in Texas's job creation, startups and emerging tech firms also make a significant impact. The state's robust startup ecosystem has flourished in cities like Austin, with the city's favorable business environment and its appeal to young entrepreneurs creating a thriving scene for new ventures. The growing number of venture capital firms and startup accelerators in the state has made Texas an attractive destination for aspiring tech entrepreneurs.\nStartups in sectors like artificial intelligence, blockchain, health tech, and fintech are creating new jobs that not only drive the economy but also introduce fresh talent into the workforce. The diverse range of roles in startups—from software engineers and product developers to marketing professionals and data scientists—enables tech workers to find a variety of opportunities that align with their skills and career aspirations. In this way, Texas's startup ecosystem is fueling innovation while also expanding the range of job opportunities available to its tech workforce.\nThe Ripple Effect: Indirect Job Creation in Texas's Tech Ecosystem\nThe expansion of the tech industry in Texas has had a ripple effect on indirect job creation. As tech companies continue to grow, the demand for complementary services increases, creating employment opportunities in various sectors such as real estate, marketing, and transportation. Real estate, in particular, has benefited from the influx of tech workers and companies, as cities like Austin and Dallas have seen an increased demand for office space, housing, and related infrastructure.\nAdditionally, local service industries—such as retail, food, and hospitality—have expanded as a result of the tech boom, with more workers moving into the region. This growth in service-sector employment helps sustain the broader economy, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a wide range of industries beyond the direct tech workforce.\nEducation and Workforce Development: Preparing for Future Tech Jobs\nTo sustain its growth as a tech hub and to meet the rising demand for skilled workers, Texas has invested heavily in education and workforce development. Many universities and community colleges across the state have introduced tech-focused degree programs, partnerships with local tech firms, and training initiatives designed to prepare students for careers in the tech industry. Schools like the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University have long been recognized for their strong computer science, engineering, and business programs, producing a steady stream of graduates who are ready to enter the tech workforce.\nWorkforce development programs such as coding boot camps and apprenticeship programs are also gaining traction in Texas, providing accessible pathways to tech careers for individuals from diverse backgrounds. These programs are designed to equip participants with the technical skills required by companies in fields like software development, cybersecurity, and data analysis, helping to bridge the talent gap and ensure that Texas has a highly skilled workforce capable of supporting its growing tech sector.\nRemote Work: Expanding Opportunities for Tech Workers\nThe rise of remote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has further expanded job opportunities in Texas's tech industry. Many tech companies have adopted hybrid or fully remote work models, allowing them to recruit talent from across the state, the country, and even internationally. This flexibility has made Texas even more attractive to tech workers who value the opportunity to work for top-tier companies while enjoying the state's lower cost of living and high quality of life.\nRemote work has also enabled smaller cities and rural areas in Texas to benefit from the tech job boom. Tech workers no longer need to be concentrated in urban centers like Austin and Dallas; instead, they can work remotely from smaller towns, contributing to local economies and helping to distribute the economic benefits of the tech sector more widely across the state.\nConclusion\nTexas's tech industry has proven to be a driving force in job creation, with its combination of major corporations, a thriving startup ecosystem, and a pro-business environment creating a fertile ground for innovation and employment. The state's ability to attract top tech talent and its commitment to education and workforce development position it well for continued growth in the tech sector. As tech companies expand and diversify, the impact of the tech industry on Texas's job market will only grow stronger, benefiting a wide range of industries and contributing to the state's overall economic prosperity. Whether through direct employment in tech roles or the ripple effects in related industries, Texas's tech boom is a key contributor to job creation and an essential pillar of the state's economic future.",

    "excerpt": "WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today released a report, 'High Tech, Low Inclusion: Diversity in the High Tech...",
    "summary": "WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today released a report, ' High Tech, Low Inclusion: Diversity in the High Tech Workforce and Sector from 2014 - 2022 ' which highlights demographic disparities for workers in 56 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations and the industries employing them.\nThe report assesses the current state of diversity in the high tech workforce and those employed in the high tech sector. It also discusses the most common discrimination charges filed by high tech sector workers with the EEOC, building on previous reports from 2016 and 2017 by the EEOC and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), respectively.\nThe EEOC report released today acknowledges that employers have made limited progress toward including qualified workers of all backgrounds in the high tech sector and high tech workforce but concludes that significant barriers still remain to equal employment opportunity in high tech. The magnitude of the underrepresentation for some demographic groups, particularly for women and Black workers, combined with research and the EEOC's experience enforcing anti-discrimination laws, suggest that discrimination likely contributes to the relatively low employment of women, Black workers, Hispanic workers, and older workers in high tech.\n'Sixty years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, there is a high degree of underrepresentation and a disturbing lack of career advancement for female, Black, and Hispanic workers in the high tech workforce, despite the recent period of growth in high tech occupations. America's high tech sector, which leads the world in crafting technologies of the future, should not have a workforce that looks like the past,' said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows. 'These data raise serious questions that deserve serious answers.'\nBurrows said, 'At the Commission, we will work to identify instances in which discrimination has contributed to these disparities. It is important for high tech employers to self-assess and address any discriminatory barriers limiting employment opportunities and to implement proactive policies to increase inclusion. Everyone deserves access to these high tech opportunities, which often provide competitive pay, benefits, job security, and stability.'\nFindings from the report include:\nFemale, Black, and Hispanic workers remained substantially underrepresented in the high tech workforce and sector. Between 2005 and 2022 there was very little change in the representation of Black workers and virtually no change in the representation of female workers occurred in the high tech workforce. (see Section III)\nBlack, Hispanic and Asian workers were underrepresented in managerial positions compared to their participation in the high tech workforce overall. (see Section V)\nWhile women are nearly half of the total U.S. workforce, they were just 22.6% of the high tech workforce in all industries, and only 4% of the high tech workforce in the high tech sector. (see Section V, Tables 11 and 12)\nThe high tech workforce is generally younger than the total U.S. workforce; 40.8% of the high tech workforce are ages 25 to 39, but only 33.1% of the overall workforce. Workers over age 40 in the high tech workforce lost ground between 2014 and 2022, declining from 55.9% to 52.1%. (see Section V, Table 9)\nCharges of discrimination filed with the EEOC in the tech sector were more likely to involve discrimination based on age, pay, and/or genetic information than those filed in other sectors. (see Section VII)\nGiven its findings, the report recommends that high tech companies proactively examine barriers limiting employment for women, older workers, Black workers, and Hispanic workers.",

    "summary": "Georgia Tech is coming off of a loss to Notre Dame, but the Yellow Jackets are only one win away from making their second consecutive bowl game under head coach Brent Key. It will not be easy to get there however, as their final four games are tough. Georgia Tech travels to Virginia Tech this Saturday, then hosts No. 6 Miami and NC State, and finishes up with a trip to No. 2 Georgia. It is not a given that Georgia Tech is going to get to a bowl game.\nAll of the major bowl projections still have Georiga Tech in the postseason.\nESPN's Kyle Bonagura has Georgia Tech going to Boston to play in the Fenway Bowl and their opponent is Memphis. The Tigers are 6-1 this season and the only loss they have suffered so far this year is to Navy, who is currently undefeated. Like Georgia Tech, Memphis has a win vs Florida State. This would be the fourth-ever meeting between the programs and Georgia Tech leads the all-time series. It would be their first meeting since 1982.\nESPN's Mark Schlabach has Georgia Tech going to another location. He has the Yellow Jackets going to El Paso to play in the Sun Bowl and their opponent is Oregon State. The Beavers are currently 4-3 this season and still have their work cut out for them as far as making a bowl game goes. Georgia Tech and Oregon State have never played each other before.\nOver at 247Sports, Brad Crawford has Georgia Tech projected to play in the Military Bowl vs Navy and that would be a very interesting matchup. Navy is currently undefeated and hoping to make the College Football Playoff as the Group of Five Champion and they face Notre Dame this weekend. This would be the 26th all-time meeting between the two programs, with Georgia Tech leading the series 16-9. They have not faced each other since 2001.\nAt the Action Network, Brett McMurphy has a very interesting matchup for the Yellow Jackets. He has Georgia Tech going back to Tampa Bay to play in the Gasparilla Bowl, but this time to face the Florida Gators. After getting blown out by Miami to start the season, Florida has rebounded a little bit and now sits at 4-3. They have a very tough stretch to end the season, but they are playing better than they were at the beginning of the season. Georgia Tech has a big lead in the all-time series vs the Gators, leading it 23-9. It has been over 40 years since they have played though with the last meeting coming in 1981.\nWith the season winding down, Georgia Tech has four more opportunities to get to another bowl game.\nAdditional Links:\nGeorgia Tech Football: 2027 EDGE Rusher D'ante Seals Recaps Game Day Visit Against Notre Dame\nGeorgia Tech Football: PFF Grades and Snap Counts vs Notre Dame\nGeorgia Tech Football: Key Takeaways From The Yellow Jackets 31-13 Loss to Notre Dame",

    "summary": "Georgia Tech concludes October with a trip to Blacksburg, Virginia, where the Hokies of Virginia Tech await inside Lane Stadium.\nThe Yellow Jackets (5-3, 3-2 ACC) could view Saturday's contest as a rubber match of sorts: A win over the Hokies would give Tech six wins before November for the first time since 2014 and make Tech 12-1 under coach Brent Key following a loss. A defeat would give Tech its first losing streak since October 2022 and put it in grave danger of falling short of bowl eligibility, with only three games remaining after the weekend.\nOn paper, Tech has a favorable matchup on offense if it can rediscover its ground game. Virginia Tech has one of the worst rushing defenses in the country at 170.3 yards allowed per game. But the Hokies do have the second-best pass defense in the ACC, and that could be a concern for the Jackets, given that starting quarterback Haynes King likely will miss a second consecutive game with an injury.",

    "summary": "today.\nit was a methodical drive for Georgia Tech on their first possession. Pyron was finding his tight ends on this drive, hitting Josh Beetham and Jackson Hawes for two first downs, but the drive stalled out in Virginia Tech territory. Brent Key made the decision to put Aidan Birr out there for a 34-yard field goal attempt. Special teams have been a thorn in Georgia Tech's side this year, but Birr made it and capped off a 12 play, 59-yard drive for GT and they led 3-0 in the game.\nNeeding a response from their offense, Georgia Tech proceeded to go three and out. The good thing is, a good punt from David Shanahan, a penalty on Virginia Tech, and really good tackling forced the Hokies to go three and out on their next possession. Georgia Tech got the ball back quickly. With not much time left, the Yellow Jackets defense did get a stop and prevented the Hokies from adding to the lead. Virginia Tech went into the half leading 14-6.\nOnce again though, the Georgia Tech defense and special teams came through. They did not allow the Hokies to gain anything and sacked Drones on 3rd down to force a 55-yard field goal attempt. Zeek Biggers blocked it and gave Georgia Tech its best field position of the day.\nWe have summarized this news so that you can read it quickly.

    "summary": "Florida has long been known for its sun, beaches, and vibrant tourism industry. However, in recent years, it has emerged as a hotspot for tech companies seeking a more favorable business environment. From tax incentives to a highly skilled workforce, Florida's business-friendly policies are reshaping its economy. The state is now being recognized as a growing tech hub, rivaling traditional innovation centers like Silicon Valley.\nThe Appeal of Florida's Tax-Friendly Climate\nOne of the key reasons tech companies are flocking to Florida is its tax structure. Florida is one of the few states in the U.S. without a personal income tax. This feature is highly attractive to both businesses and employees. For tech entrepreneurs and employees, this means more take-home pay. It also allows companies to offer competitive salaries without the burden of excessive taxation.\nFor businesses, Florida offers corporate tax rates that are lower than many other states. This is particularly beneficial for tech startups and small companies, where managing overhead is critical to survival. Furthermore, the state offers a variety of tax credits and exemptions aimed at fostering innovation. These include incentives for research and development, which are particularly appealing to tech companies focused on innovation. The combination of these financial benefits makes Florida a prime location for companies looking to reduce costs while still having access to a dynamic market.\nStrategic Location and Infrastructure\nFlorida's geographic location also plays a significant role in its appeal to tech companies. With its proximity to Latin America and Europe, Florida serves as a gateway for international business. Many tech companies with global ambitions are drawn to the state for its strategic access to these markets.\nIn addition to its strategic location, Florida boasts a robust infrastructure that supports business growth. The state has invested heavily in its transportation network, including airports, seaports, and highways, making it easier for businesses to connect with clients and partners around the world. This level of connectivity is especially important for tech companies involved in global commerce, logistics, or international services.\nAdditionally, Florida's telecommunications infrastructure is state-of-the-art, providing tech companies with reliable and fast internet, cloud services, and data storage capabilities. This is crucial for industries like fintech, cybersecurity, and software development that rely heavily on digital infrastructure. The combination of these logistical and digital advantages ensures that companies have the resources they need to succeed.\nA Supportive Regulatory Environment\nFlorida's regulatory environment is another factor that contributes to its attractiveness to tech companies. The state government has made efforts to reduce bureaucratic hurdles that often stifle business growth in other regions. Florida is known for having fewer regulations compared to other states, making it easier for businesses to operate. For tech companies, which often need flexibility to innovate and grow, this lighter regulatory touch is highly appealing.\nThe state also supports a fast-track permitting process for businesses, enabling companies to set up operations quickly. This is especially beneficial for tech companies that need to be agile and responsive to market changes. In addition, Florida offers strong protections for intellectual property rights, a critical concern for tech companies whose products and services often revolve around proprietary technology. The ease of doing business, combined with strong legal protections, makes Florida a compelling destination for tech firms.\nA Growing Tech Talent Pool\nWhile the financial and regulatory environment is critical, access to talent is equally important for tech companies. Florida has recognized this and has invested in education and workforce development programs aimed at creating a skilled labor pool for the tech industry. The state is home to several top-tier universities, including the University of Florida, Florida State University, and the University of Miami, which have strong engineering and computer science programs.\nThese universities are producing a steady stream of graduates with the skills necessary to thrive in the tech industry. Additionally, Florida has made significant investments in technical schools and coding bootcamps, offering students hands-on experience in tech-related fields. This ensures that companies have access to a diverse talent pool with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.\nFurthermore, the state's affordable cost of living and high quality of life make it an attractive destination for professionals. Unlike more expensive tech hubs, such as Silicon Valley or New York, Florida offers a more affordable lifestyle without sacrificing career opportunities. This has led to a migration of tech talent from other states, further strengthening Florida's tech workforce.\nThe Rise of Tech Innovation Clusters\nAs more tech companies relocate to Florida, the state is seeing the development of innovation clusters. Cities like Miami, Orlando, and Tampa have become magnets for tech startups, venture capital firms, and incubators. Miami, in particular, has earned the nickname 'Silicon Beach,' as it attracts tech entrepreneurs and investors looking for a more affordable and livable alternative to Silicon Valley.\nOrlando has become a hub for simulation technology and video game development, thanks to the presence of companies like EA Sports and the University of Central Florida's world-renowned simulation and training program. Tampa is home to a growing cybersecurity industry, with companies like ReliaQuest and the University of South Florida's cybersecurity program driving innovation in the field.\nThese tech clusters create a network effect, where the presence of tech companies attracts more tech companies, investors, and talent. This virtuous cycle leads to further innovation, job creation, and economic growth. It also creates a supportive ecosystem where entrepreneurs can access funding, mentorship, and resources necessary to scale their businesses.\nGovernment Support and Incentives for Tech Growth\nFlorida's state government has played an active role in fostering a business-friendly environment that supports tech growth. The government offers a variety of grants, tax credits, and incentives aimed specifically at tech companies. Programs like the Qualified Target Industry Tax Refund (QTI) provide financial incentives for companies that create high-wage jobs in the state.\nIn addition to financial incentives, Florida's government has launched initiatives to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. The Florida Innovation Hub and various tech incubators across the state offer resources for startups, including office space, mentorship, and networking opportunities. These initiatives are designed to support the growth of new companies and ensure that Florida remains competitive in attracting tech talent and businesses.\nFurthermore, Florida's government has actively worked to attract tech giants and established companies to the state.

    "summary": "The UK's technology sector continues to be a driving force behind economic growth, innovation, and job creation. However, with the sector expanding rapidly in some areas while slowing down in others, where should tech professionals focus their job search in 2024? A comprehensive new analysis has revealed the best and worst places for tech jobs across the UK, based on key metrics such as salary growth, job availability, and commute times.\nLondon Remains a Powerhouse for Tech Jobs, but Growth is Spreading\nUnsurprisingly, the City of London remains the UK's top destination for tech jobs in 2024, achieving a near-perfect score of 90.00. The city boasts the highest hourly wages for tech professionals, averaging £30.15, alongside shorter daily commutes, making it an attractive option for workers seeking both financial reward and a better work-life balance. Despite a modest wage growth of 1.55% over the past three years, the tech sector has expanded, with 2,610 tech enterprises and a growth rate of 6.97%.\nHowever, the report reveals that thriving tech ecosystems are no longer exclusive to London. Areas like Middlesbrough, Westminster, and Hackney are experiencing impressive growth, providing excellent opportunities for tech workers in more affordable regions.\nMiddlesbrough: A Rising Star in the Tech Sector\nOne of the most surprising findings is the rapid growth of Middlesbrough's tech sector. With a growth rate of 13.79% – the fastest in the UK – Middlesbrough is positioning itself as a key player in the UK's tech landscape. Although the city's tech firms are fewer in number (165 enterprises), they present solid opportunities for job seekers looking to enter a burgeoning market. Workers in Middlesbrough also enjoy a respectable hourly wage of £15.13, combined with a relatively short commute. As the sector continues to grow, the area is expected to attract more companies and talent, making it one to watch in 2024.\nWestminster and Hackney: Solid Performers in the Tech Space\nWestminster and Hackney also rank highly among the top tech job destinations. Westminster, in second place with a score of 89.8, offers the third-highest number of tech firms (5,730) and is the second-fastest-growing tech hub, with an 8.22% growth rate. Hackney, ranking fourth, boasts a well-rounded tech scene, where a significant portion of the workforce (10%) is employed in the tech sector. Workers in Hackney benefit from attractive salaries (£23.90 per hour) and one of the highest pay rises in recent years at 27.81%.\nThe Regions Falling Behind: Thurrock and Bexley\nWhile the tech sector flourishes in some regions, others are facing significant challenges. Thurrock has been ranked as the worst area for tech jobs in 2024, with a shrinking tech sector and a dramatic 35.48% decline in enterprises. Despite offering an average hourly wage of £16.33, the area's lack of growth and mediocre commute options make it less appealing for tech workers. Similarly, Bexley's tech sector is declining at an even faster rate (36.41%), despite recent wage increases. These findings highlight the growing regional disparity in tech job availability and sector health.\nKey Findings from the 2024 Tech Jobs Report:\nCity of London : Highest score of 90.00, with the highest wages (£30.15/hour) and shortest commute.\nMiddlesbrough : Fastest-growing tech hub, with a 13.79% growth rate and a solid final score of 80.07.\nHackney : One of the highest pay rises in the UK tech sector at 27.81%, with a score of 88.28.\nWestminster : The third-highest number of tech enterprises (5,730) and strong wage growth.\nThurrock\n: Worst-performing area with a shrinking tech sector and a 35.48% decline in enterprises.\nBalancing Pay and Work-Life Balance\nWhile wages are undoubtedly an important factor, the report highlights the significant role commute times play in overall job satisfaction. Areas like Hackney and the City of London offer some of the shortest commute distances, giving employees more time for personal pursuits. Conversely, areas like Manchester, despite having a strong tech presence, suffer from long daily commutes, which may negatively impact work-life balance.",

    "summary": "Tech lobbying is taking part in a pivotal role in reshaping Florida's regulatory framework. As tech companies continue to expand their presence in the state, their influence on key issues like data privacy, cybersecurity, and workforce development will only grow. For businesses, understanding the impact of tech lobbying is essential for staying competitive and compliant in an increasingly digital economy. Whether you're a tech startup or a traditional business looking to leverage digital tools, staying informed about the regulatory environment in Florida is more important than ever. By keeping an eye on the shifting landscape, businesses can position themselves for success in the Sunshine State's evolving tech ecosystem.\nThe Rise of Tech Lobbying in Florida:\nTech lobbying, the organized effort by technology companies to influence legislation and public policy, has seen a significant increase in Florida over the past decade. While Silicon Valley remains the epicenter of tech innovation, Florida has emerged as an attractive hub for tech startups, thanks to its favorable business environment, lower taxes, and a growing tech talent pool.\nThis rise in tech presence has naturally led to increased lobbying activity. Tech companies are keen to influence Florida's legislative decisions, particularly in areas like data privacy, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. The influx of tech companies in the state is not just about bringing jobs; it's also about ensuring that the regulations governing their operations align with their business models and future growth strategies.\nKey Drivers Behind Tech Lobbying Efforts:\nSeveral factors have contributed to the surge in tech lobbying in Florida:\nData Privacy Laws:\nWith data privacy becoming a hot-button issue globally, Florida has become a battleground for discussions on how personal data should be managed and protected. Tech companies, especially those in social media, e-commerce, and data analytics, are keen to influence how stringent these laws become.\nInfrastructure Investment:\nTech companies are pushing for more investment in digital infrastructure, particularly 5G networks and broadband expansion. Florida's diverse geography, from dense urban areas to rural communities, presents unique challenges that tech lobbying seeks to address.\nTax Incentives and Business-Friendly Policies:\nFlorida has long been known for its low-tax environment, but tech companies want to ensure that new regulations do not disrupt this favorable business climate. Lobbying efforts are often geared towards maintaining or enhancing tax incentives that benefit tech firms.\nWorkforce Development:\nAs the demand for tech talent grows, companies are advocating for policies that promote STEM education and workforce development programs. Ensuring a steady pipeline of skilled workers is crucial for the long-term success of Florida's tech industry.\nThe Impact of Tech Lobbying on Florida's Regulatory Framework:\nTech lobbying in Florida is not just about tweaking existing regulations; it is reshaping the state's entire approach to governance in the digital age. Here are some of the key ways in which tech lobbying is influencing Florida's regulatory framework:\nData Privacy Regulations:\nOne of the most significant areas where tech lobbying has made an impact is in data privacy regulations. Florida has been considering legislation similar to California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which gives consumers more control over how their personal data is collected and used. Tech companies, particularly those heavily reliant on user data, have been actively lobbying to ensure that Florida's version of the law is business-friendly.\nWhile consumer advocates push for stricter privacy protections, tech lobbyists argue that overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation and harm businesses that rely on data for targeted advertising, personalization, and other digital services. The outcome of these lobbying efforts will have far-reaching implications not only for tech companies but also for businesses that operate in sectors where data is a valuable asset.\nCybersecurity and Digital Infrastructure:\nAs Florida continues to position itself as a tech hub, cybersecurity and digital infrastructure have become top priorities. Tech lobbyists are pushing for state investment in robust cybersecurity measures to protect both businesses and consumers from digital threats. This includes advocating for stronger cybersecurity standards, more funding for digital infrastructure, and policies that promote public-private partnerships in cybersecurity.\nAdditionally, tech companies are lobbying for the expansion of 5G networks and broadband internet access across the state. With remote work becoming the norm and digital services expanding, having a reliable and fast digital infrastructure is crucial for the state's economic growth. Lobbying efforts have been instrumental in shaping Florida's approach to these issues.\nTax Policies Favoring Tech Growth:\nFlorida's tax policies have long been a draw for businesses, particularly its lack of state income tax. However, tech companies are advocating for even more favorable tax policies that can help them grow and scale their operations. This includes tax incentives for research and development (R&D), as well as tax breaks for tech startups and venture capital investments.\nThe tech industry's lobbying efforts have focused on ensuring that Florida remains competitive with other states that offer similar incentives. For businesses, particularly startups, these tax policies can make a significant difference in their ability to attract investors and scale quickly.\nWorkforce and Talent Development:\nThe rapid growth of Florida's tech sector has created a strong demand for skilled workers, particularly in areas like software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI). Tech companies have been actively lobbying for policies that promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and workforce development programs.\nThese efforts include advocating for increased funding for STEM programs in schools, expanding apprenticeship and internship opportunities, and creating pathways for tech workers to transition from other industries. For businesses, this focus on talent development is crucial, as it ensures a steady supply of skilled workers needed to stay competitive in the digital age.\nChallenges and Controversies Surrounding Tech Lobbying:\nWhile tech lobbying has undoubtedly shaped Florida's regulatory framework, it has also sparked controversy. Critics argue that tech companies have too much influence over state policy, leading to regulations that favor big business at the expense of consumer protection and fair competition. For example, some consumer advocacy groups have voiced concerns that tech lobbyists are watering down data privacy laws to make them less effective.\nAdditionally, small businesses and startups that lack the resources for large-scale lobbying efforts may find themselves at a disadvantage in a regulatory environment shaped by big tech companies. As tech giants push for regulations that suit their business models, smaller firms may struggle to comply with complex regulatory requirements, creating barriers to entry and stifling innovation.\nWhat Businesses Should Know:\nFor businesses operating in Florida, the influence of tech lobbying on the regulatory framework presents both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, tech-friendly regulations can create a more favorable environment for businesses that rely on digital tools and services. On the other hand, the evolving regulatory landscape can create compliance challenges, particularly in areas like data privacy and cybersecurity.\nBusinesses should stay informed about changes to Florida's regulatory environment, particularly those influenced by tech lobbying. Engaging with industry groups and staying active in policy discussions can help businesses navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure their interests are represented.\nConclusion:\nSince recent years, technology has advanced at an unprecedented rate, and with it, the role of tech companies has evolved from being mere providers of digital services to powerful stakeholders shaping state policies. Nowhere is this more evident than in Florida, where tech lobbying efforts have begun to reshape the regulatory landscape. The Sunshine State, once known for its relaxed regulatory environment, is now at the forefront of a transformation driven by the tech industry's growing influence. For businesses operating in Florida or looking to expand into this market, understanding the implications of tech lobbying on the regulatory framework is essential. This article provides key insights into how tech lobbying is reshaping Florida's regulations and what it means for businesses.",

    "excerpt": "In an industry where women continue to challenges, tech entrepreneurship requires resilience, innovation, and financial acumen.",
    "summary": "Why Women Tech Founders Need Specialized Financial Support\nIn an industry where women continue to challenges, tech entrepreneurship requires resilience, innovation, and financial acumen. However, despite the growing number of women stepping into tech leadership roles, the unique challenges they face often necessitate specialized financial support tailored to their specific needs.\nThe funding landscape is still an uphill battle for women tech founders. Despite increased awareness, women founders consistently receive a disproportionately low share of venture capital funding. Women-led startups garner less than 3 percent of total venture capital funding, a statistic that reveals the deep-seated gender biases still prevalent in the investment community. This lack of capital directly impacts a company's ability to scale, develop products, and attract talent.\nSpecialized financial support, such as the services of a fractional CFO, can make a significant difference. Financial professionals who understand the challenges of women tech founders can strategize to build and pitch a solid financial narrative that resonates with investors. This guidance not only helps founders secure funding but also equips them to demonstrate the strong financial fundamentals that VCs look for, bridging the funding gap in a sustainable way.\nTech businesses face unique financial and compliance challenges, particularly as they grow. Between regulatory requirements, intellectual property concerns, and data protection laws, tech companies operate in a complex legal and financial environment. For women tech founders, who may have fewer industry connections or mentorship opportunities, navigating these challenges can feel isolating.\nFinancial professionals with tech sector expertise can provide invaluable assistance, guiding founders through regulatory landscapes, implementing data protection budgets, and setting up financial strategies that align with compliance obligations. This support helps reduce the risk of costly compliance issues and offers peace of mind to the founder.\nCash flow is often the primary challenge for tech startups, especially those led by women, who might have to navigate funding cycles that favor their male counterparts. Many women tech founders bootstrap their ventures initially, making cash flow management essential for survival and growth. Specialized financial support from a fractional CFO can provide critical insights into managing cash flow effectively. They can set up cash flow projections, identify potential cash shortages before they arise, and advise on the right moments for investment and scaling.\nStrategic scaling is another area where women tech founders can benefit from specialized financial insight. Growth decisions should be based on precise financial data, and an experienced fractional CFO can bring this clarity. With the right financial counsel, women tech founders can make data-driven scaling decisions that protect their equity, reduce unnecessary debt, and improve long-term profitability.\nWomen in tech, especially founders, often face unique market risks. Due to industry volatility and biases, women tech founders may experience additional scrutiny in times of economic downturns, making them more vulnerable to financial instability. A fractional CFO who understands the nuances of the tech world and has a focus on resilience can help founders develop a solid financial cushion to withstand market fluctuations.\nWith financial resilience as a core goal, specialized financial support can help tech founders create emergency funds, optimize capital allocation, and set financial controls to prevent unexpected financial strain. This resilience enables women founders to adapt to changing market conditions, focus on long-term innovation, and maintain control of their ventures.\nMany women tech founders, particularly first-time entrepreneurs, face challenges around financial literacy and confidence. Having a financial expert who is not only skilled but empathetic to the unique experiences of women founders can help close this confidence gap. Specialized financial support builds financial literacy by providing clear explanations, actionable insights, and support tailored to the founder's comfort level.\nWhen women tech founders are equipped with financial knowledge, they gain the confidence to take charge of their company's financial direction. This shift often translates into greater authority in negotiations, a clearer understanding of growth potential, and a heightened ability to make sound financial decisions. Increased financial literacy strengthens their position as leaders and ultimately contributes to a more inclusive tech landscape.\nEmpowering Women Tech Founders for the Future\nWomen tech founders have immense potential to drive innovation, create jobs, and contribute to a more inclusive economy. Specialized financial support plays a critical role in empowering these founders, helping them overcome funding gaps, navigate complex regulatory challenges, and build financially resilient companies. By investing in specialized financial support, we can support women tech founders in taking the helm confidently and fostering a tech ecosystem that thrives on diversity, equity, and innovation.\nThe bottom line is that for any woman tech founder, having a specialized financial team or fractional CFO who understands the tech landscape is no longer a luxury - it's a necessity. The tech industry's future will be brighter and more innovative when we provide all founders with the tools they need to succeed. Let's commit to making that a reality.",
