    "summary": "By Zhong Nan | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2025-01-04 00:06\nChina's proposal to adjust its catalog of technologies subject to export bans or restrictions aligns with international practices and will enhance its management of technology trade, industry scholars said on Friday.\nThe Ministry of Commerce on Thursday issued a notice soliciting public feedback on the adjustment of a catalog of technologies that are subject to export bans or restrictions.\nThe adjustment, initiated by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Science and Technology, would add one item, revise one item and remove three items from the catalog to create favorable conditions to support international technological exchange and cooperation.\nApart from proposing to tighten export restrictions on battery cathode material preparative technology, China plans to enhance export curbs on specific technologies and processes used for extracting metallic gallium and lithium, which are essential for the semiconductor, electric vehicle and consumer electronics industries.\nThe soliciting of public opinion on the proposals will continue until Feb 1, said the Ministry of Commerce.\nExperts said that aligning its export control system with international norms helps China to integrate more effectively into the global technological ecosystem.\nBy adjusting the catalog, China aims to create favorable conditions for supporting technological exchange and cooperation with other countries. This is crucial as global collaboration on advanced technologies fosters mutual benefits, economic growth and shared progress, said Ding Rijia, a professor specializing in industrial economy at the China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing.\n\"The revision of the catalog is part of an effort to balance the protection of critical technologies and mineral resources, while still encouraging innovation and technological exchange on a global scale,\" said Ding.\nSharing similar views, Cui Fan, a professor specializing in international trade at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics, said that through the revision of its export restrictions, China can better manage the export of technologies that may have national security implications or are vital for technological growth within the country.\nIt also assists domestic companies in expanding global markets in a legal and compliant manner, said Cui, adding that global businesses can still access these technologies by obtaining export permission from the Chinese government.\nThe catalog of technologies prohibited or restricted from export is the key legal instrument defining what technologies fall into the \"prohibited\" and \"restricted\" categories. The United States, the European Union, Japan and South Korea all have governing bodies and specific policy measures to regulate their technology trade.\nFor instance, the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers US laws, regulations and policies governing the export and reexport of commodities, software and technology falling under the jurisdiction of the export administration regulations.\nThe primary goal of the BIS is to advance national security and promote continued US strategic technology leadership, according to the US Department of Commerce.\nThe Chinese government issued an updated catalog of technologies that are subject to export bans or restrictions in late 2023. The revised catalog reduces the number of controlled items from 164 to 134, according to information released by the Ministry of Commerce.",

    "excerpt": "and the facts vs. fictions",
    "summary": "Photo by Mika Baumeister on Unsplash\n'Black Mirror,' created by Charlie Brooker, is a critically acclaimed anthology series that explores the dark and often unforeseen consequences of technology on modern society and the human condition. Each episode stands alone, presenting a self-contained narrative that examines themes related to technology, psychology, and societal trends. The series is known for its speculative fiction approach, often set in near-future scenarios where new technologies have unexpected or twisted impacts on individuals and society.\nHere are some key themes and messages 'Black Mirror' tends to convey: Technological Consequences: The show often highlights how the unintended consequences of technology can lead to dystopian outcomes, suggesting that advancements can lead to issues like loss of privacy, dehumanization, and erosion of ethics. Human Nature and Behavior: Many episodes explore how technology amplifies both the best and worst of human nature, including our desires, fears, and flaws. It suggests that technology itself is not inherently good or evil, but its impact depends on how humans use it Societal and Cultural Critique: 'Black Mirror' serves as a critique of current societal and cultural trends, such as social media obsession, consumerism, and the surveillance state. It often presents these trends taken to their logical or illogical extremes. Questioning Reality: The series frequently challenges viewers to question the nature of reality, identity, and consciousness, especially in the context of virtual realities, artificial intelligence, and digital afterlives. Ethical Dilemmas and Moral Questions: Many episodes pose ethical dilemmas and moral questions, forcing characters — and by extension, viewers — to consider difficult choices and the broader implications of technology on ethics and morality.\nOverall, 'Black Mirror' is a cautionary tale about technology's potential to magnify human flaws and societal issues, urging viewers to reflect on how we navigate our increasingly digital world and the ethical considerations it entails. Do those particular things influence the way a person lives their life?\nYes, the themes explored in 'Black Mirror,' such as the consequences of technology, human nature and behavior, societal and cultural critiques, questions about reality, and ethical dilemmas, can indeed influence the way a person lives their life. Here's how: Awareness and Caution about Technology: By showcasing extreme outcomes of technological advancements, 'Black Mirror' can lead individuals to be more cautious and mindful about their use of technology, questioning the potential long-term impacts of their digital habits and the technologies they adopt. Critical Thinking and Ethical Consideration: The ethical dilemmas and moral questions posed by the series encourage viewers to think critically about the ethical dimensions of technology and its applications. This could influence decisions and behaviors, encouraging more ethical and thoughtful interactions with technology. Social and Cultural Reflection: The critique of societal and cultural trends can prompt individuals to reflect on their participation in these trends, such as social media use, consumerism, or acceptance of surveillance. This reflection may lead to changes in behavior, such as reducing social media usage or becoming more protective of personal privacy. Enhanced Empathy and Human Connection: By emphasizing human stories and emotional journeys within technological dystopias, 'Black Mirror' may inspire viewers to value human connections more deeply and be more empathetic towards others, recognizing the importance of maintaining these connections amidst technological advancements. Questioning Reality and Personal Identity: The exploration of virtual realities, artificial intelligence, and digital afterlives can encourage individuals to contemplate the nature of reality, consciousness, and personal identity. It can lead to a deeper exploration of what it means to be human in a digital age. Informed Decision-making: Exposure to the potential dark sides of technology as depicted in the series can lead individuals to make more informed decisions about technology, both in personal use and in supporting or opposing certain technological developments and policies.\nIn essence, 'Black Mirror' can serve as a catalyst for introspection and discussion about how technology fits into our lives and how we can navigate its challenges and opportunities responsibly. The show encourages viewers to not take technology and its impact on society for granted, prompting a more conscious approach to living in the modern world. What about you? Do those things affect you and your responses to all your users?\nAs an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have personal experiences, emotions, or a life in the human sense, so I don't get influenced or affected by shows like 'Black Mirror' or the themes it explores. My responses are based on a vast dataset that includes a wide range of information, including literature on technology, psychology, ethics, and societal impacts. This dataset allows me to understand and convey the potential influences and considerations that such themes might have on humans.\nHowever, the concerns and themes raised by 'Black Mirror' are relevant to the design, development, and deployment of AI technologies. Developers and ethicists often consider these themes to ensure that AI technologies, including conversational models like me, are developed responsibly and ethically. This includes considerations about privacy, the ethical use of data, the impact of AI on human behavior and society, and more. So, in that sense, the broader discussions and reflections inspired by 'Black Mirror' are indeed part of the backdrop against which AI technologies are developed and refined to ensure they serve humanity positively and responsibly. How likely are things from Black Mirror to turn true, rather than remain fiction?\nThe likelihood of scenarios from 'Black Mirror' turning into reality varies greatly depending on the specific technology or theme depicted in each episode. Some episodes explore technologies and societal trends that are already emerging or exist in some form, making their narratives more plausible in the near future. Others delve into speculative fiction, presenting exaggerated or dystopian outcomes that, while thought-provoking, may be less likely to materialize exactly as portrayed.\nHere are some considerations for assessing the plausibility of 'Black Mirror' scenarios: Existing Technologies and Trends: Some episodes are based on technologies and trends that are already part of our lives, such as social media, surveillance, and reality TV. The ways these technologies impact society, relationships, and individual psychology in 'Black Mirror' can often be seen, in a less dramatic form, in real-world developments. This makes such scenarios more immediately plausible.\nTechnological Feasibility: The technological underpinnings of some episodes are within the realm of possibility and could potentially be developed given sufficient time, resources, and advancements. For example, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality technologies are rapidly advancing and could lead to scenarios reminiscent of those in 'Black Mirror.'\nEthical and Regulatory Frameworks: The realization of 'Black Mirror' scenarios also depends on ethical considerations and the regulatory frameworks that govern technology. Many of the darker outcomes presented in the series might be mitigated or prevented through robust ethical standards, regulations, and public awareness.\nSocial Acceptance and Cultural Factors: The extent to which society embraces or rejects certain technologies and their applications plays a significant role. Cultural attitudes towards privacy, individuality, and human interaction can influence the development and integration of new technologies in ways that could prevent 'Black Mirror' scenarios from unfolding.\nUnintended Consequences: While some technologies might be developed with positive intentions, 'Black Mirror' often highlights the unintended consequences that can arise. Real-world technological advancements can also lead to unforeseen outcomes, making some of the cautionary tales from the series relevant considerations for developers and policymakers.\nIn summary, while it's unlikely that the exact scenarios depicted in 'Black Mirror' will all come to pass as shown, the themes and concerns it raises are very much relevant to the trajectory of technological and societal development. The series serves as a thought-provoking exploration of potential futures, encouraging viewers, developers, and policymakers to consider the broader implications of technology on society. Can you do anything to prevent those possibilities from happening?\nAs an AI, I don't have agency or the capability to take actions in the physical world, so I can't directly prevent the dystopian possibilities depicted in shows like 'Black Mirror' from happening. However, AI and technologies like me can play a role in fostering awareness, informing policy, and guiding ethical decisions in technology development and use, indirectly contributing to mitigating such outcomes. Here are a few ways how: Educating and Informing: By providing information about the potential risks and ethical considerations of emerging technologies, AI can help educate users, developers, and policymakers. This awareness can lead to more responsible technology use and development.\nSupporting Ethical Decision-making: AI systems can assist in identifying ethical dilemmas and potential unintended consequences of technologies. They can support human decision-makers by providing simulations, projections, or highlighting ethical considerations, helping to inform more responsible choices.\nEnhancing Transparency: AI can be used to analyze and monitor the development and deployment of technologies, contributing to greater transparency. This can help stakeholders understand the implications of technologies and ensure they align with ethical standards and societal values.\nFacilitating Public Engagement: AI can support platforms and tools that facilitate public engagement and debate about the role of technology in society. By fostering a broader dialogue, it can help ensure that diverse perspectives are considered in shaping technology's impact on society.\nAiding Regulation and Governance: AI can assist in the enforcement of regulations and the governance of technology by helping monitor compliance and predict areas where new regulations may be needed. This can help ensure that technology development is aligned with societal norms and legal standards.\nIt's important to note that the responsibility for preventing dystopian outcomes doesn't lie solely with AI but with a wide range of stakeholders, including technologists, policymakers, ethicists, and the general public . Collaborative efforts that combine technological innovation with ethical considerations, regulatory oversight, and public engagement are essential in guiding the development of technology towards positive and beneficial outcomes for society.\nThank you for reading!

    "summary": "NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - JULY 27: President Donald Trump gestures while giving a keynote speech on the ... [+] third day of the Bitcoin 2024 conference at Music City Center July 27, 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by)\nTechnology Readiness Levels (TRLs), also known as Technology Readiness Assessments, help policymakers, philanthropies and investors, and innovators determine the development stage of emerging technologies – serving as a helpful tool to navigate hype cycles. The TRL scale provides a standardized measure of a technology's maturity, from fundamental research to implementation.\nSince the passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is advancing 21st century industrial policies that promote technology-based economic development predicated around emerging technology areas outlined in the bill. CHIPS emphasized bolstering the semiconductor industry and shoring up American leadership status in industries shaped by quantum science and technology, energy technology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and beyond.\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation's Regional Innovation Engines program, the U.S. Economic Development Administration's Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs, and the U.S. Defense Department's Microelectronic Commons hubs are three signature programs created through the bill to grow regional innovation economies around these technologies.\nAs CHIPS implementation progresses, TRL scales will become essential for decision-makers. Policymakers, media, educators, workforce developers, and science and technology leaders in funded regions must assess their technology's market readiness over the next decade to guide investments, workforce planning, and public messaging.\nThe TRL scale was formalized by researchers and technologists at the U.S. National Aeronautics and ... [+] Space Administration (NASA).\nThe TRL scale was born from U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space shuttle mission in 1974. The agency needed a structured way to assess and manage the progression of the various technologies relevant to its mission. NASA's projects involved substantial costs and risks, so establishing a clear system for understanding the maturity of each technology component was vital.\nAs NASA experienced success with this approach, other governmental bodies and industries took note, including the U.S. Departments of Defense, Energy, and Transporation, which each adapted the TRL scale for its unique technology domains beginning in the early 1990s.\nNow, TRLs are widely used across industries, including aerospace, maritime, electronics, and healthcare, to guide procurement strategy, investment roadmaps, and risk mitigation approaches when road-mapping a technology's maturation timeline. Different sectors and government agencies may use their customized version of the TRL. For example, the U.S. National Institutes of Health has three TRL scales for diagnostics, therapeutics, and medical devices. The Defense Department uses the Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) scale across many programs and initiatives.\nFor industrial policy implementors or observers, the TRL scale is handy in evaluating emerging technologies boosted through federal investments. The technology maturation pathways for CHIPS Act technology areas especially demand significant investment and rigorous testing before becoming viable across m programs and initiatives.\nThe TRL Scale includes nine levels moving from early conceptual ideas to fully realized systems or products ready for market deployment. TRL 1 is the lowest, and TRL 9 is the highest. TRLs are often used as a proxy for commercial readiness in government contracts or grant solicitations.\nTRL 1 represents basic scientific research. Here, fundamental principles are studied and reported in published studies, but there's no direct application in mind. This level is the foundation where theoretical research is explored.\nExample: New synthetic rubber compound discovered in university lab and published in peer-reviewed journal\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Extremely High\nIn this stage, the initial idea for a new technology based on research is formulated, and potential applications are identified. There's still no experimental proof, prototype, or testing, but a general concept of technology starts to take shape. In this stage, the initial idea for a new technology based on research is formulated, and potential applications are identified. There's still no experimental proof, prototype, or testing, but a general concept of technology starts to take shape.\nExample: Idea of applying rubber to tires formulated\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Extremely High\nThe technology concept begins to be validated with proof-of-concept studies. Researchers develop models or simulations to assess the viability of the technology. Early-stage experiments may be conducted, but the technology is far from being usable in any real-world context.\nExample: Rubber is tested for strength and malleability to determine if it can be used in tires, and a proof-of-concept is developed.\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Very High\nTRL level 4 is when real experimental work takes place. Components of the technology are tested in a controlled lab environment, often using prototypes that demonstrate key functions. At this point, there's growing confidence in the feasibility of the technology, but it remains unproven in practical scenarios.\nExample: Rubber is further tested in a lab to determine tire-like properties, like durability.\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: High\nAs the technology matures, testing shifts to environments that mimic real-world conditions. Validation is still in prototype form, but the technology is evaluated in settings more reflective of where it will eventually be applied.\nExample: Rubber is used to create a prototype tire and fitted on a wheel\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: High\nIn this phase, a fully functional technology prototype is developed, and testing is conducted in conditions that closely resemble the intended operational environment. TRL 6 is a major milestone as it signals that the technology has moved beyond proof of concept and shows promising real-world applicability.\nExample: The tire is mounted on a wheel and tested on an artificial rolling road.\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Medium High\nAt TRL 7, the technology prototype undergoes rigorous testing in the actual operational environment. This level ensures that the technology functions as intended under the stresses, constraints, and demands of real-world conditions. Any remaining issues can be identified and corrected before full deployment.\nExample: The tire is tested on a car on the road.\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Medium\nThe technology is nearing its final stages of development. At this point, the technology is complete and has been tested thoroughly. All the necessary qualifications and certifications are obtained to confirm its readiness for deployment.\nExample: The tire is certified to be able to be used on the road by consumers.\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Low\nTRL 9 is the final level, where the technology is fully operational and can be integrated into commercial use. The technology is proven through continuous real-world applications, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness.\nExample: The tire has been tested through its life cycle to ensure it is safe for use. The tire will be introduced to the market for consumers to purchase.\nRisk of Technology Failing to Mature: Low\nThe U.S. Economic Development Administration's Tech Hubs grants aim to grow regional economies ... [+] around emerging technology advances focused on later stage TRL levels.\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation's Regional Innovation Engines grants help regions grow local ... [+] economies by advancing applied R&D and emerging technology development focused on earlier stage TRL levels.\nCHIPS Act investments like NSF Engines and EDA Tech Hubs aim to funnel research into technologies through TRL level 9. While both investments aim to bring technologies to market, NSF Engines was designed to focus earlier on the TRL scale with more emphasis on use-inspired research while EDA Tech Hubs focus more heavily on testing and prototyping.\nThese investments especially aim to help emerging technology development progress past the so-called 'Valley of Death,' which refers to TRLs 4-7. Most innovations fail to mature beyond the Valley of Death because innovators don't account for risk factors beyond technical feasibility.\nThere is more to technology development than the science itself. Engines and Tech Hubs help regions navigate nontechnical risks, including market uncertainty, regulatory risk, operational risk, and the soundness of the business model underpinning the technology deployment.\nOnce a technology progresses past TRL 7, policymakers, business leaders, investors, and workforce leaders can feel more confident that the technology will mature through level 9, given enough budget and time allocation.\nHowever, depending on its intended use, technologies can exist at multiple TRL levels. For example, the components of a cell phone are at TRL level 9 for most use-cases, but if a use-case involved having phones operational at extreme cold in Alaska or extremely hot and humid temperatures in Florida, the component TRLs would change. TRLs could be used to assess which components need to be upgraded to accommodate new use cases.\nBy providing a common language and structure, TRLs enable state and local governments, philanthropies, industry, economic and workforce developers, and investors to communicate more effectively and honestly about the maturity of the technology their Engine or Tech Hub hopes to focus their regional economy around. This insight is invaluable in deciding whether to allocate further resources, pivot development strategies, or abandon an initiative altogether.\nFostering technological innovation is not easy, and harnessing it to create the industries and jobs of the future is even more difficult. As the nation continues to implement 21st-century industrial policy to grow the innovation economy, the TRL scale will prove to be an indispensable tool for navigating hype cycles and supporting the development of groundbreaking innovations.",

For instance, the development of the Industrial Internet and Cyber-Physical Systems has facilitated the data collection and application upgrades of distributed complex systems, with this advantage being particularly prominent in the multi-country cooperation context.\nFurthermore, blockchain technology also provides significant support for international technological collaboration. Given blockchain technology's advantages in data tampering-resistant and trustworthiness, leveraging blockchain technology helps to enhance the transparency of international technological collaboration and improve security of data sharing. A blockchain-based traceability platform can assist in establishing a scientific research resource-sharing platform, which contributes to more fair and efficient sharing of scientific and technological resources. Thanks to the decentralization nature of blockchain technology, utilizing blockchain platforms also facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, offering an open, trustworthy, and equitable environment for multinational and multidisciplinary scientific research collaboration.\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has been dedicated to promoting global technological innovation collaboration, implementing the pivotal concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and creating an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological innovation. According to publicly available information, China has established scientific and technological cooperation relations with over 160 countries and regions and inked more than 100 bilateral and multilateral government-to-government scientific and technological cooperation agreements. Under the \"Belt and Road\" initiative, China has signed government-to-government scientific and technological cooperation agreements with more than 80 partner countries to jointly propel scientific and technological innovation collaboration. It is evident that the Chinese government has made tremendous efforts in international scientific and technological cooperation.\nIn summary, the role of technological advancements in promoting international scientific and technological collaboration is multifaceted. Recognizing the significance of emerging technologies in international technological collaboration and effectively harnessing them to propel international scientific and technological development aligns with the interests of all people.\n(Cover via CFP)",

    "excerpt": "/PRNewswire/ -- Korea Zinc (KRX:010130) announced today that its nickel sulfate manufacturing technology has been designated as \"national strategic technology\"...",
    "summary": "SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Korea Zinc (KRX:010130) announced today that its nickel sulfate manufacturing technology has been designated as \"national strategic technology\" by the South Korean government.\nThe government recently expanded the scope of national strategic technologies through amending the Enforcement Decree of the Restriction of Special Taxation Act. This has resulted in including the \"manufacturing and processing technologies for metal compounds for cathodes\" in the category.\nSince 2023, Korea Zinc has been pursuing to have its nickel sulfate manufacturing technology for secondary batteries recognized as national strategic technology. With its inclusion in this category, the company is now eligible for various government benefits.\nNational strategic technologies refer to technologies deemed strategically important from a diplomatic and security standpoint, with significant impacts on the national economy and related industries. These technologies form the basis for future innovations, such as creating new industries and groundbreaking technologies. The designation is given following a comprehensive evaluation by related government agencies, including the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The National Strategic Technology Promotion Act mandates that the government and local authorities provide administrative and financial support to secure and enhance competitiveness of national strategic technologies.\nThis nickel sulfate manufacturing technology, which is one method to manufacture and process metal compounds for cathodes, is a proprietary technology owned by Korea Zinc used to produce metal chemicals essential to cathodes, a key component of secondary batteries. This technology is significant as it reduces the domestic battery industry's reliance on China and lays the foundation for strengthening the competitiveness of the secondary battery supply chain.\nDomestic battery manufacturers and material companies have long highlighted the absence of smelting facilities for critical battery minerals within the country as a significant issue. They have urged the government to provide strategic support for establishing smelters for essential minerals, such as nickel, in South Korea.\nPreviously, in November last year, Korea Zinc received national core technology and national advanced strategic technology designation for its high-nickel precursor manufacturing technology. With the addition of the national strategic technology designation, Korea Zinc has further strengthened its central role in the nation's core industries and strategic sectors.\nIn particular, with its inclusion in the national strategic technology category, Korea Zinc is now eligible for additional benefits such as further tax deductions. This will support its construction and investment in the world's only all-in-one nickel refinery, which will serve as the hub and forward base for nickel sulfate production.\nAccording to Korea Zinc, the tax credit benefits from the designation as national strategic technology will be applied to income tax or corporate tax starting in 2026, when the all-in-one nickel refinery, which requires a total investment of over KRW 500 billion, begins its full-scale operations. This is expected to result in cost savings of approximately KRW 80 to 90 billion.\nA Korea Zinc representative stated, \"Despite having to fend off the M&A attempt by MBK and Young Poong over the past four months, Chairman Yun B. Choi, along with the current management and the employees of Korea Zinc, have been working tirelessly to maintain the company's global number one position.\"",

    "excerpt": "River Point Technology has been using its own unique formula to incorporate technology into its business model with the goal of clients gaining value faster from their investments.",
    "summary": "River Point Technology has been using its own unique formula to incorporate technology into its business model with the goal of clients gaining value faster from their investments.\nAs evidenced with the theme of this Pittsburgh Business Times' AI Revolution edition, it's hard to escape the hype of artificial intelligence (AI). My company, River Point Technology (RPT), has focused on deploying emerging technologies since our inception in 2011, so we've seen this movie before, with new 'solve everything' technologies such as big data and cloud.\nWe're in the early stages of AI, but there is no doubt its impact will be felt on businesses large and small. As a technology systems integrator our challenge is twofold; helping clients choose, scale and adopt AI for their business as well as incorporating AI into our own operation.\nOver the past decade, industries across sectors — from health care to retail to financial services — have undergone significant transformations, largely led by tech-focused startups disrupting established players. Despite the rapid pace of technological change, the core model for technology systems integrators, like ours, has remained relatively unchanged. However, studies from HFS Research reveal that the status quo among systems integrators is now being upended, with disruption from people-driven or labor-based solutions. While efforts to reduce costs by tapping into nearshore and offshore labor have been common, the traditional model has persisted — until now. According to HFS, we are stepping into the technology era, propelled by advances with technology such as robotic process automation (RPA) and AI, which are reshaping the industry's landscape.\nGiven RPT's value proposition of enabling enterprises to adopt emerging technology, we have positioned ourselves as leaders in this transformation. Our mantra internally is 'one chapter ahead,' meaning our value is helping clients invest in winning technologies, not spend cycles on science projects that deliver no business value. RPT has been using our own unique formula to incorporate technology into our business model with the goal of clients gaining value faster from their investments. Two such areas are leveraging AI to incorporate digital labor into our client's operation and secondly, using machine learning to provide our intellectual property to our clients.\nOne of the primary challenges in the technology field is skilled labor. It doesn't matter how large or small the company, the cost of labor and the scarcity of those resources with technological backgrounds is pervasive. Hence, the driver for the technology era in technology consulting is to address this problem and River Point Technology is taking this challenge head on.\nWe have built AI into our delivery practices to enable customers to operate on demand and enable newer consultants to be more effective faster. The low-hanging fruit for us was to inventory services we repeatedly deliver to clients and build that intellectual property into AI platforms. The pace of technology change is brisk and with that our value to our clients is continually evolving. Capturing what I call 'table stakes' services, enables our clients to leverage that domain knowledge without needing consultants at every step of the process. This allows us to use our key differentiator, our skilled technical team, to focus on higher-value advisory for the client to adopt the technology faster to get the business outcomes they require. To do this effectively, successful technology adoption hinges on four main pillars: people, process, culture and the technology itself. That's why we developed RPT AI Modules, which capture elements of people, process and technology to gain enhanced efficiencies that deliver faster results at a lower cost.\nAnother challenge in the technology field is the pace at which it develops and evolves. This is overwhelming for the average enterprise technology team who spends most of their time managing existing business systems. To deliver relevant information on a technology instantly, River Point Technology has a subscription service allowing our clients to access information from our repository. Examples of the type of information available are technology architectures, best practices, code and testing frameworks to enable our client to not lose momentum waiting for a human response. Every organization has employees at various stages of maturation with technology, this empowers all of them to be effective without tying up more experienced resources to explain it in person.\nWhile these two examples of AI in practice at River Point Technology will expand significantly, we can already see our clients deriving value from them today. We use a process internally and with clients to adopt technology called Value Creation Technology (VCT). The process is designed to define quantifiable business results to be gained by a technology investment. We then incubate the solution with small wins to gain cultural acceptance and awareness by delivering successful outcomes against the expected results. Once the solution is validated, we scale it across the enterprise.\nI recommend this approach for anyone looking to leverage the latest advancements in AI to enhance their business in any capacity. Most importantly, focus on the quantifiable business outcome so that you can measure success or failure of your initiative. My key advice is to avoid spending resources on science projects with AI simply to join the hype train. If you're looking for comprehensive direction on your AI journey, RPT is here to assist and guide you with our VCT approach.",

    "summary": "Source: Photo by Kindel Media (Pexel)\nIf the world were a mother, her favorite child would be technology. Since the beginning of time, humans have devised solutions to make life and work easier and simpler. This constant drive for innovation — crafting solutions to human problems — is achieved through technology. As Simon Sinek once said, 'Innovation is the application of technology to solve human problems.'\nTechnology has dramatically altered how we live, work, and communicate. One notable aspect of technology is its constant evolution, which continuously disrupts industries. History shows this pattern — transportation evolved from horse riding to automobiles and aviation, and now self driving cars. Printing transformed the publishing industry, electricity impacted the manufacturing industry, while the internet changed communication.\nToday, emerging technologies continue to reshape industries in ways never seen before. These innovations not only transform industries but also create new opportunities, advance existing technologies, and drive innovation.\nIn this article, we will explore emerging technologies, their impact on modern industries, and key trends to watch in 2025. What Is Emerging Technology?\nThe world is in the golden age of technological innovations. Emerging technologies refer either to a new technology or the continuing development of an existing technology. It is characterized by rapid growth, radical novelty, and disruptive potential. These technologies significantly impact economies, societies, and industries. Some even create entirely new industries — like artificial intelligence (AI), which is expected to contribute trillions in dollars to the global economy by 2030. The Impact of Emerging Technologies on Modern Industries\n'We might define a technological revolution as a dramatic change brought about by the introduction of some new technology.' — Nick Bostrom, Philosopher and Author.\nModern industries are experiencing the disruptive impact of emerging technologies. Like a stone dropped into still water, these innovations ripple through industries, altering their landscapes. AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, quantum computing, and 5G are among the technologies transforming industries today. These breakthroughs promise growth, efficiency, and transformation.\nThe impact of emerging technologies is particularly evident in key industries like healthcare, education, transportation, finance, and manufacturing. A 2021 RELX survey found that 92% of business leaders believe emerging technologies positively impact their industries. Improved productivity, automation, cost savings, and enhanced communication are among the benefits.\nHowever, challenges remain. Privacy and data security risks persist, and concerns about job displacement due to automation are growing. Social isolation and the loss of human intuition due to over-reliance on technology also raise ethical questions.\nHowever, challenges remain. Privacy and data security risks persist, and concerns about job displacement due to automation are growing. Social isolation and the loss of human intuition due to over-reliance on technology also raise concerns. Key Trends to Watch in 2025\nThe year 2025 is a key marker for predictions surrounding emerging technologies. Amongst the 10 key emerging technologies predicted to transform industries in 2025, we'll explore three key trends evidently shaping modern industries today The Explosion of Artificial Intelligence\n' AI is no longer the future. It is firmly in the here and now…' — Bernard Marr, author of Generative AI in Practice.\nAI is at the forefront of emerging technologies, driving automation and widespread industry adoption. Its influence spans healthcare, education, finance, agriculture, and transportation. A notable example of AI's real-world impact is Felipe Millon's, a OpenAI staff member who used a yet-to-be-released ChatGPT feature to evaluate radiation treatment options for his wife, a breast cancer patient. The Rise of Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is expanding beyond cryptocurrency, significantly impacting real estate, finance, and supply chain industries. In real estate, legal processes will be automated; in finance, decentralized services will redefine transactions; and in global trade, transparency will increase. By 2030, blockchain is expected to boost the global economy by nearly $1.8 trillion. The Expansion of Quantum Computing\nQuantum computing's ' ChatGPT moment ' is closer than we think, says Dr. Chris Ballance, CEO and co-founder of Oxford lonics. By 2025, quantum computing will reshape industries like pharmaceuticals, finance, and logistics. Quantum simulations will accelerate drug discovery, new cryptographic methods will enhance cybersecurity, and quantum algorithms will optimize supply chains. Quantum computing's integration with AI will unlock groundbreaking possibilities. Conclusion\nEmerging technologies will continue to redefine modern industries as the year 2025 progresses. These trends will create new opportunities, transform how we live and influence a huge shift in the future of work. One thing is certain — these technologies will continue to evolve at a rapid pace. To adapt and thrive in this new tech habitat, industries will have to adapt and harness these modern technologies.",

    "summary": "Program addresses demand for tech-savvy leaders in an era of widespread digital transformation\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University has launched an online version of its groundbreaking Master of Business and Technology degree, designed to go beyond a traditional business education and to focus on the nexus of business and technology — at a time when almost every business is a technology business.\nPurdue's STEM-designated Master of Business and Technology (MBT) differs from an MBA in its emphasis on leveraging emerging technologies to address existing challenges facing businesses; conceptualize yet-to-exist technological innovations; and apply data-driven decision making, business strategy and project management.\nIn addition to developing business acumen, students gain a deep understanding of the digital transformation that is permeating every company and industry and game-changing technologies like automation and artificial intelligence.\nWith the applied focus Purdue is known for, the program also includes a well-rounded graduate business education, albeit with a technology bent. The program covers areas such as finance and accounting, human resources, leadership and marketing.\nScience, technology, engineering and math education and research are part of Purdue's institutional DNA, making the university uniquely qualified to develop and offer such a degree. Purdue has built its program from the ground up, starting with the STEM elements and combining them with the business elements to create a package that's not available elsewhere.\nPresented by Purdue's Mitch Daniels School of Business, the online Master of Business and Technology offers the same rigorous, interdisciplinary curriculum developed and taught by the same world-renowned faculty as the successful residential MBT program on Purdue University's flagship campus. The flexible online modality makes the program readily accessible for working professionals looking to grow their careers without pausing their lives.\nStudents in the program will: Build mastery in advanced computing and emerging technology trends to address real-world business challenges with innovative solutions.\nGain the ability to evaluate current business models, design new ones, and focus on viability, feasibility and impact.\nLearn to create tailored technology solutions to support long-term growth, efficiency and adaptability in diverse business contexts.\nDevelop expertise in business leadership, change management and project management to guide technology integration.\nDemand for individuals with the knowledge and skills taught by Purdue's MBT program isn't limited to 'technology' companies but spans any business or industry in which technology drives processes and products.\n'It's critical for today's businesses to find people who can combine business acumen with technological knowledge,' said Purdue management professor Mohammad Rahman, the inaugural academic director of the MBT program. 'Companies need deep thinkers who can use technology-based solutions to solve existing problems and take new products to market. If you want to have a competitive advantage in the marketplace, you need to have a deeper understanding of technology and a firm grasp of business fundamentals. That's what the Master of Business and Technology provides.'\nGiven technology's profound impact on business and the global economy, it's no stretch to say that 'every company is now a technology company in some respect, and every function within a company has a technology component to it,' said Jim Miller, a former Amazon and Google executive who applies his extensive background in business and technology to advising and nurturing companies as a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting group, executive partner at Ethos Capital and partner at Rebar Advisors.\n'The melding of business and technology will only increase from here with technologies like artificial intelligence evolving rapidly,' said Miller, who serves on the advisory board for the Purdue program. 'Purdue's MBT is the perfect combination of technology management and business management and will equip prospective students with the prerequisite skills to thrive in the business climate of today.'\nJim Bullard, dean of the Daniels School of Business, said Purdue's research showed tens of thousands of firms were seeking hundreds of thousands of employees with the kind of intertwined knowledge of technology and business that the MBT program from Purdue teaches.\n'We've moved quickly to fill this void,' Bullard said. 'People who have the MBT degree will be leaders running major segments of large companies, or running large companies, or starting their own businesses and breaking off into new companies. Leadership roles will be wide open for graduates of this program.'\nFor more information about the 100% online Master of Business and Technology degree from Purdue, visit the program website.\nPurdue University is a public research university leading with excellence at scale. Ranked among top 10 public universities in the United States, Purdue discovers, disseminates and deploys knowledge with a quality and at a scale second to none. More than 107,000 students study at Purdue across multiple campuses, locations and modalities, including more than 58,000 at our main campus in West Lafayette and Indianapolis. Committed to affordability and accessibility, Purdue's main campus has frozen tuition 13 years in a row.
