    "summary": "Jyotishman Pathak, an internationally recognized leader in biomedical informatics and population health sciences, will be the inaugural dean of the new School of Technology for Public Health at Arizona State University, effective July 1. Jyotishman Pathak\nIn this critical role, Pathak will help build and launch a first-in-the-nation school shaping an emerging and critically important field that harnesses the power of technology to address pressing public health challenges and opportunities at the local, national and global levels.\nAn integral part of ASU Health, the School of Technology for Public Health aims to create a new and rapidly evolving space for the integration of digital technology, data-driven decision-making and a significant focus on local impact within public health. The school will contribute to the development of a technologically sophisticated workforce that will power the field of public health and is expecting to welcome its first cohort of students in the Master of Public Health and Master of Public Health Technology programs in fall 2025.\nThe new school was designed by working with national industry leaders who examined the needs in public health. The effort was co-chaired by Dr. Susan Blumenthal, a retired rear admiral and former U.S. assistant surgeon general, and Sir Malcolm Grant, chancellor of the University of York and founding chairman of England's National Health Service.\n'Dr. Pathak is an ideal leader for our new School of Technology for Public Health. He has been leading an extremely productive and well-funded program of research utilizing medical informatics and digital health technologies, including AI, to design and deploy solutions to a range of critical health problems,' ASU Executive Vice President and University Provost Nancy Gonzales said. 'He has the track record we were seeking to blend technology and public health in innovative ways that will be core to the identity of the new school.'\nPathak is recognized as a leading researcher, educator and innovator in the field of informatics and behavioral health, and is a generous mentor of faculty and students, Gonzales added.\n'We are very excited that he will be joining ASU as a new dean and a member of the ASU Health leadership team,' she said.\nPathak currently is the Frances & John L. Loeb Professor of Medical Informatics, professor of health care policy and research in psychiatry, chief of the Division of Health Informatics and vice chair for entrepreneurship in the Department of Population Health Sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.\nHis research focuses on analyzing electronic health records, insurance claims and social determinants of health data to study mental health service utilization and treatment outcomes for depression, substance use and suicide. This work has been supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the National Science Foundation and the American Heart Association, among many other organizations. Pathak also is the co-founder of a mental health startup — Iris OB Health Inc. — that is developing digital health solutions for managing perinatal mood and anxiety disorders.\nPathak's own blend of medicine, informatics and population health sciences is what attracted him to the new role.\n'I am truly honored and humbled to serve as the inaugural dean of ASU's School of Technology for Public Health,' Pathak said. 'As a leading public research university, ASU has fostered a culture of innovation, transformation and interdisciplinary collaboration — key to tackling pressing public health challenges such as maternal and child health, mental and environmental health, infectious diseases and public health communication, among others. I am excited to partner with faculty, students, staff and communities across Phoenix and Arizona to reimagine and advance public health infrastructure, education and scholarship for the 21st century.'\nA prolific investigator, Pathak has authored over 275 peer-reviewed publications, multiple book chapters and invited editorials, and he has published a book on genomic and clinical data sharing. In 2023, he was appointed by the U.S. secretary of health and human services to the National Advisory Mental Health Council, where he advises the director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Pathak has received multiple awards from the American Medical Informatics Association, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American Heart Association, IBM Research and Weill Cornell Medicine–Qatar for research excellence, teaching and mentorship, and he serves as an editor for the American Psychiatric Association's Psychiatric News. He is an elected fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics.\nPathak earned a PhD in computer science from Iowa State University in 2007, after which he became a postdoctoral research fellow in the Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. In 2015, he joined Cornell University and resides in New York with his wife, Divya, and their two children, Anya and Aditya.\n'We are delighted that Dr. Pathak will be joining ASU Health as the founding dean of the first School of Technology for Public Health in the U.S.,' said Sherine Gabriel, executive vice president of ASU Health. 'Jyoti's academic, quantitative and administrative talents, along with his exceptional track record as a scholar, fundraiser and leader, make him an ideal choice.

    "summary": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSE:WELL) stock is up an impressive 254% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 58% gain in the last three months.\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\nView our latest analysis for WELL Health Technologies\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring the last half decade, WELL Health Technologies became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nIt is of course excellent to see how WELL Health Technologies has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at WELL Health Technologies' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.\nIt's nice to see that WELL Health Technologies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 81% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 29%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand WELL Health Technologies better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with WELL Health Technologies (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .\nWe will like WELL Health Technologies better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued stocks (mostly small caps) with considerable, recent, insider buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Canadian exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

    "summary": "New Delhi: The Union government plans to set up additional resource centres across India to evaluate the science, finance, social and ethical issues of new health technologies such as medicines and devices and disseminate evidence of their suitability and cost-effectiveness to help policymakers frame decisions for the healthcare sector.These new Health Technology Assessment Resource (HTAR) centres will also conduct training sessions, workshops and online courses for those working in state and central government health programmes.The plan by the Department of Health Research (DHR) under the ministry of health and family welfare assumes significance given the changing nature of health technologies and associated concerns. The department intends to establish the new resource centres across India in FY26.'The resource centres will be responsible for undertaking HTA studies, capacity building activities like workshops, training programmes and online courses,' the DHR said in a notice inviting expressions of interest from interested institutes. 'These centres will also be conducting HTA sensitisation workshops for state/central government health programmes and facilitate adoption of HTA recommendations by state/central government programmes.'The Office of the Health Technology Assessment in India (HTAIn) was set up in May 2023 with the responsibility to analyse health technologies such as medicines, devices and health programmes for their cost-effectiveness, clinical effectiveness and equity issues by means of HTA. This will help policymakers in decision-making for efficient use of limited health budgets and provide people with access to quality healthcare, reducing their personal expenditure on health.'From India's perspective, an evidence-based approach is the only way to generate safe, effective and sustainable healthcare decisions. HTA, or health technology assessments, will help evaluate new discoveries, drugs and technologies to see if they are really relevant to the country's population,\" said Rajeev Jayadevan, past president of the Indian Medical Association, Cochin. 'A new drug for a disease must not only alleviate the condition but also be safe and cost-effective. Without HTA it will not be possible to ensure that newer developments actually benefit the intended patients.'Existing centresAccording to the government, health technology or health intervention refers to 'an application of organised knowledge and skills in the form of diagnostics, devices, drugs including their formulations and delivery systems, vaccines, procedures, novel therapeutics, health programmes and systems developed to address a health problem and improve quality of lives including digital technologies.'Jayadevan said half of India's population is below the age of 28.6 and this translates into many individuals who could be interested in healthcare research. In sync with the Make in India theme, HTA centres can support local research on health technology innovations such as medical devices, diagnostic tools, and affordable medication by evaluating their effectiveness and cost-benefit, encouraging the adoption of Indian-made solutions.The government has called on interested institutes with the required research capability and resources to apply by 15 February.The Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Jodhpur, National Institute of Virology in Pune, National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research in Karnataka and Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru are among 19 institutes that have established such resource centres. These centres have helped achieve policy briefs on health issues such as intraocular lenses, cervical cancer screening and the safety of syringes.Following the covid-19 pandemic, the health tech sector gained momentum in India. It was valued at about $10.6 billion in 2022 and expected to grow to $21.3 billion by 2025. The market is growing due to increased government investment in healthcare infrastructure and rising demand for advanced healthcare solutions.",
